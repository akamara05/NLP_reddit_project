In the current law of the USA, it states that schools have the right to limit student expression like forms of speech such as obscene, disruptive, or lewd language. I want to know if you could sue a school for suppressing speech for the sole reason of it containing words that could be seen as obscene. And if so, is there a definition of obscene or disruptive and who defines it?

For example, if a student expressed an opinion but used a swear in it, like ""This class is fucking boring"" and was subsequently asked not to swear and given a detention for swearing, could the child's guardian sue the school for suppressing his opinion? If the child/guardian believed the child was being targeted by the school for said opinion and not the swearing, would that hold up or would the court rule in favor of the school for punishing swearing?

This is in regards to the personal data a potential employer is asking for to run a background check. I'm totally fine with them having to do so to verify my identity, etc. They are using ADP to manage most of the data gathering and forms they need to run all the checks they require, which are:  Governmental Registries Search, Wants and Warrants, Criminal Records Search (ADP Crim Radar, Criminal Court Records), and Social Security Number Death Master Search.    


I then asked them the following:  *Another question before I proceed - what does the company do with the data once received? Does it get destroyed/removed from your system once the background check is completed? If this is not the case - is the data secure, i.e. what guarantees to privacy/access to personal data does the company and it's affiliated partners provide? I'm asking purely because the company will be in possession of my personal data and with the number of data breaches happening on a daily basis, want to make sure it's protected.*  

They responded after a week with the following:

*Regarding the HR-side of filing personal data, we need to keep personal information on file for future verification purposes, with purging taking place usually every 7 years. Physical items are stored in locked cabinets in a locked HR office. Our electronic files are stored in an internal share drive folder that is only accessible by HR, as well as in a private HR Teams channel, which are all protected and backed up securely by a server with access by admins only.*

*If you need any further information than this, please feel free to let us know! In the meantime, we will still need your consent (both online via ADP as well as via attached form) in order to begin your required background check processing.*

I'm a little concerned with the wording here, i.e. calling out ""HR-side"" of filing versus the company as a whole and also - why 7 years? I was reading online that it's standard, but where are the employee data protections? Note - the attached form is a paper form they need filled out and I'm not sure where it's being sent to. (Google hasn't been helpful, which is why I'm turning to the folks here)Why can't I have my data purged when asked? For context, this is a company based in New York State.

I know this is coming off overly paranoid, but one of my former employers (also in NYS) fell victim to a phishing scam and someone stole all their employee data (the CIO is an idiot).

We have received complaints from neighbors, violations from the city, and late utility payment notifications. My mother feels trapped in this agreement and wants to get out of it. But there is a problem.

The lessee claims to have invested an unknown amount of money into the property. There is also a challenging clause in the contract: ""It is agreed that if for any reason this contract goes into default and converts back to Lessor, all payments and monies spent including down payment, insurance, repairs, improvements, taxes, and maintenance will be refunded to Lessee by Lessor. In the event of default of this Agreement by Lessor, Lessor shall be liable for all attorney fees and court cost incurred in the enforcement of this agreement.""

We've talked to a lawyer who says he wants no part in the case due to it being too convoluted. He was on board with evicting the lessee for a $2,500 charge, but he quickly changed his mind when finding out about the money invested in the property. He said this will be a nightmare and it is not worth pursuing. It was recommended that my mother should foreclose on the property. The attorney argued that the contract was not filed in court (notarized in a realtor's office) and that it should be considered null and void at this point. Still, he insisted that with the money invested by the lessee, foreclosure was a better option than eviction.

We don't know what to do or where to go from here. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

As part of the accepted offer, there is a clause added to the home inspection section (lines 543-551 on form WB-11) that states:

""Buyer will not ask seller to make any repairs to the home after reviewing the results of the home inspection unless the cost of those repairs exceeds $2000 in total.""

After my home inspection, there were several small repairs and at least two major categories of repairs: masonry (chimney tuckpointing, crown repair, block window replacement) and electrical (the house has knob and tube wiring). The knob and tube was not disclosed on the seller's condition report.

My insurance will not cover a house with live knob and tube. I want the seller to decommission the knob and tube and have the circuits rewired, which will exceed $2000. My buyer realtor is saying I'll have to pay for it if I want it repaired because of the clause above, but that makes no sense to me.

1.) Can I get a gut check that based on the home inspection findings, I should be able to ask for the seller to complete my requested repairs?.

2.) I've lost a lot of confidence in my buyer agent. I know I can't exclude him from the deal, but is it okay to directly interact with the seller agent at this point?

3.) It seems like if I can interact with the seller agent, I just need to complete a WB-41 requesting the repairs and provide a copy of the report. Any tips on language that is used for this?

My wife, son, and I are moving into an apartment this coming Friday. I first viewed the property about a month ago. When I viewed the property, the former tenants were still occupying the space. The place was messy, dirty, and smelled like pets. The person giving me the tour told me that they would be taking all of their deposit most likely to get the place ready for move-in. However, the place was very large, with multiple stories, bonus space, etc. The rent was higher than our current residence, but we have to leave due to personal circumstances.

Anyway, I explained the layout of this place to my wife. Combined with that and the central location, along with the fact that the rental market was so hot that we were losing places just because we wanted to look at them (""I'm getting offers for deposit without having to show the place so why would I waste my time,"" was one response), we decided to place the deposit down and stop our frenzied apartment searching.

During both the walkthrough and when I stopped by the office a few weeks ago, I was told that the place would technically be cleaned, etc. by mid-August.

So this past Wednesday we went to view the property so my wife and son could see it in person. As you have probably guessed, the apartment was not really in good shape. It was certainly wiped down, but that's not being cleaned. There was grime and dust all over the place, the oven and fridge were dirty, there were dirty bits of paper towels lying about. The paint didn't look fresh, and there certainly wasn't a fresh paint smell, unless fresh paint has magically started smelling like cat piss. My wife and I informed the employee that gave us the walkthrough that we thought this was unsatisfactory. My wife couldn't even finish walking through the house due to the condition. However, she didn't seem alarmed or concerned at this and said she'd pass the message along.

So, again, move-in is this Friday and I am uncertain of what to do. We can't really stay in a hotel or anything until this gets sorted, but I'm worried that once I move in, the company gets to wash their hands of neglecting their responsibilities. So in this timeline, what are my options? Do I call, leave a letter, get a lawyer ASAP? Or are they technically within their rights to leave the place however they wish considering whatever NY state laws require and the fact that we already gave a deposit and signed a lease. Alarm bells are going off now but I'm not sure if it's too late.

My apartment building has recently started using a service called Fetch which accepts packages on behalf of residents to redeliver them to their door. However when I signed my lease, no such system was in place, rather we had parcel lockers that were free for us to use.

My lease is a fixed term 12 month lease. My lease agreement states regarding packages:

&gt; Residents are responsible for making arrangements for parcel delivery that does not fit in the provided mail receptacle. Owner representatives are not authorized to sign for parcels. This includes parcels from UPS, Federal Express, U.S. Postal Service or other mail and delivery services

Management has tried sending me an addendum for the change to use Fetch packages but I've refused to sign it, in addition I've never agreed to the Fetch terms of service. I told them that I would like to keep the current solution of me picking up packages in the lobby, which the only objection from them was that ""it would be inconvenient as I had to be present to accept packages"". I'm like OK well I'm at home all day anyway.

I've recently found out that packages are now being forcefully rerouted to Fetch even when addressed to my building and unit. They did this without notifying me or warning me that they would be rerouting packages and I now have a package stuck there (I had no problems getting things delivered before). The packages was a UPS package, and tracking says it was signed by someone I don't know. Management is requiring me to sign up and pay $16/month in order to receive it, is this legal?

I'm thinking this sounds like mail fraud to me. I've never given permission to anyone to reroute my mail yet they're doing it anyway (or are packages not covered under mail protection laws?), and now someone who I didn't authorize is signing and accepting packages on my behalf, and holding it hostage until I pay. It just seems unreasonable to me that a landlord can take mail addressed to me and say that I have to pay money to get it back without my permission or prior warning they were going to do so.

It seems like they're trying to trick people to use it as well, particularly because they keep sending announcements and reminders to use Fetch without ever mentioning it costs $16/month. Heck even the addendum fails to mention it, the addendum just states that you may be subject to additional fees. I only know this because I asked them directly if it was free.

Honestly I don't know what's wrong with my building's management. I signed a $3300/month lease for 12 months and they're trying to trick me to spend an extra $16/month that was never mentioned or agreed upon originally. Baffles me why they can't just eat the cost until my lease ends and would rather just give me a terrible experience by taking my packages hostage just to coerce an additional 0.48% out of me. Seems like they're begging for bad reviews.",legaladvice,"Apartment building has rerouted packages mailed to me, given it to a third party, and says I have to pay $16/month to get it back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8vump/apartment_building_has_rerouted_packages_mailed/

I want to be clear that I've had nothing to do with the conversations mentioned below, I've just heard about them. But I have seen the neighbor and his antics, and seen the terrible fence.

A couple of years ago, my mom's neighbor died and his house was sold. This is a rectangular 2x10 block of houses, so the backyards back up to each other with a fence line (mix of cedar/chain) down the middle. The house was bought by a 20-something guy, which we can call Jeff. By all accounts, he's not a good neighbor; he'll throw things into my mom's yard, he plays loud music until the early morning, and he hosts parties a lot and the guests park on my mom's lawn.

A couple of years ago he got one of those nondescript white dogs, so he decided to put in a fence. There previously had not been a fence between the two houses. My mom agreed to pay for half of either a cedar or chain link fence to match what was up on the back of the properties, but didn't sign the paperwork that the city required for a fence to be put up. Jeff went out and bought this hideous, strange white vinyl thing off of craigslist that's barely waist high, and started putting it up. It verifiably looks terrible, like to the point of it possibly decreasing the property value. When my mom went and talked to him to say, this isn't what I agreed to / I'm not paying for it / I didn't sign anything, he yelled at her and advanced on her and she ran back into her house. She called the police but they said it was a civil issue and they weren't going to do anything about it.

Since then, she's going to the building department multiple times, she's tried to get a surveyor out, she's tried to get her own fence put up, etc etc. She has never been successful in finding any kind of resolution. She called the building department and asked for her plat and told them about the fence, and they said they'd call her back - two weeks later a woman calls and said, I'm from the building department and drove by your house and don't think the fence looks bad so I'm not going to help you (???). When she understandably called and asked to speak to a director in the building department, she recounted to me that he had an answer about the situation so quickly as if he had been warned about her. He said he's got her signature that the fence was okayed, and that she can't put her own fence up against his. Despite the fact that she never signed anything, she has never been successful in finding a resolution to this terrible fence, and she said that police will drive by often (in the middle of a neighborhood where I cannot remember ever having seen police drive by).

The most recent occurrence in the saga: All the houses in the neighborhood have a sidewalk out front, and then grass past that, before the road. My mom's house is the only one that has gravel instead of grass in that area. Jeff got some work done to his house and the contractors kept leaving construction vehicles, trailors, etc parked in the gravel so it was sometimes hard for her to get out of the driveway - plus, she lost any parking out front. She decided to change it over to grass and then put big boulders out on the grass, so no one would park and kill the grass seed. In the interim, the city came out and repaired a water line, and for whatever reason paved over like a 8-foot segment of the grass, partway in-between the two houses, so now he's parking his giant truck on the paved segment as if he's gained this new parking spot.

My mom took spray paint and painted a line down it to show exactly where the property line extended to, which cuts the paved section in half. She put a boulder on her side of the paved section. He keeps moving the boulders back into her grass and parking his truck there anyway. She went ahead and did it again, and he saw her and yelled ""Seriously?"" and sent some guy over who yelled at her through her front door that she doesn't own any part of that, the city does, and Jeff knows all sorts of people at the city, so she can't stop him from doing whatever he wants because he has rights.

At this point, she's asking me if she needs to file for an order of protection, or if she should try to find  a lawyer for harassment. If she was allowed to put her own fence up she would pay for it 100%, if she could get the paved section broken up she would. She just has hit dead ends, she's an older woman who lives alone, and she's worried she needs to move if this doesn't stop. I am hopeful that posting here might help me point her in the right direction.",legaladvice,"My mom's neighbor may have forged her signature to install a terrible fence, is parking on her property, and is harassing her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8vpkq/my_moms_neighbor_may_have_forged_her_signature_to/

Also on mobile, so formatting is crap, and thanks to anyone willing to try.

BACKGROUND:
So, I started a war (what it feels like) with my electric co-op at the beginning of the year. Problems range from horrible customer service to blatant, unrepentant theft (such as putting customers who never got behind on their bills during covid last year on a repayment plan, and not informing other customers that they may have been overcharged). It started 10 years ago when the new GM (with no actual qualifications to run a co-op; was hired instead of an engineer with years of experience) somehow got hired for a job he didn't know how to do (can you say $60 million in debt added over those 10 years). I can expound more if needed. I've spoken to them in person, in email, and over the phone (all recorded) while they lied straight to me. This has been going on since January, and not once has any Board member addressed any customer concerns. I've done my research, and there is NO governmental oversight (although they claim that the State Co-op is supposed to provide oversight, it's really just a vicious cycle of State and National {they provide the tech that allows us to be robbed} co-ops covering each others' ass). I went so far as to contact the congressman who addressed the House in 2008, about co-ops, their lack of oversight, and the very real possibility it would be taken advantage of (spoiler alert: they're taking advantage), with very little results. I contacted the local news, and while the reporter genuinely wanted to help, the co-op gave her so much run around she couldn't really help either. I've also discovered we are not alone. I've found almost 15 other groups across the country (on FB, power co-op failures groups) that have similar, and some of the exact same problems (all of our CEOs/managers/etc go to conferences together at the state and national co-op level, giving them the opportunity to compare strategies on how to really stick it to the consumer). In the future, if I can ever actually find a lawyer with some insight, we (I and the leaders of the other groups) will take on the national co-op (provider of tech).

NOW PROBLEM:
The plan was originally (I have 2000 members or about 7% in my group, not counting the members with me who don't social media) to replace the Board through the annual vote (3-4 districts voted on per year over 3 years). However, they are now denying members who put in the work (filling out paperwork with the co-op, getting at least 50 signatures from your district to be nominated) their nominations so that they can run unopposed and keep control. This means we will have to take the board by force, which can be done. I've read a couple of articles about co-ops who successfully ousted and replaced their entire board in one go. This will require a petition to remove the whole Board (possibly separate petitions for separate members?), and I have all the questions, such as-
     *Do they have to do something blatantly       illegal to be removed?
     *Can they be removed by a vote of no confidence, alone?
     * Do we need separate petitions for each board member or can we have one that covers them all?
     *What things do I need to include (I have signed petitions but never organized one) to make sure it's valid and legal (I will be collecting thousands of signatures, mostly by myself, so I need to make sure it's not a wasted effort)?
     *Anything petition-wise that I may have left out (any and all info is appreciated)

I have attempted to find any lawyer (in my state) that could help us fight them. I called on the NC Bar Foundation's statewide service Day (free legal advice for anyone) but they only directed me to a civil attorney with no clue.

1. Is it normal for me (the client) to be responsible for costs and expenses? (e.g. filing fees, process serving, deposition, copying, and postage fees?) **In other words, this case is basically a contingency fee (36%+COSTS)**. Costs have no limitations I get what's left after the contingency any costs. That really concerns me.
2. LCP - this protects the attorney, why would I be paying this fee?
3. Case financing - the attorney can finance the case, and I am bound to pay the interest? Is this normal?
4. Setoffs and cross complaints do not affect contingency fees. I don't know what is a setoff or cross-complaint.
5. Attorney liens. Should I put any limitations on this?

Well, that's in terms of the contingency contract.

1. Separately, should I prevail in the case, is the award taxable as income? What taxes will I pay on the award? Is the lawyer fee pre or post-tax (which is better)?

Unfortunately, in the process of clearing out the garage a couple of weeks ago. we noticed some significant structural issues at the property that were not caught during our home inspection, or disclosed. 

At the rear of the garage there was a closet where the previous owners left some excess construction materials (cinder blocks, bricks old floor tiles). Upon moving those, I noticed significant shearing/shifting of the concrete block above the slab (about 1.5 inches). Upon further investigation throughout the garage it seems evident to me that the previous owners may have covered this up. Floor to ceiling peg board was installed throughout the garage along the same wall. When peeling back the peg board, the shearing is also evident. Likewise there was a panel of wood slipped behind a  work desk left in the corner to hide the shearing there.

In the disclosures sellers noted there were minor cracks but ""no shifting"". Cracks were visible during the inspection but said wall in the garage could not be fully inspected due to clutter on the inspection day. Given the timeline of these structural issues and the seeming intention to cover them up, I am wondering if we have any recourse. This is not an issue that occurs overnight and I do find it very odd that the peg board was installed to the floor and other items were conveniently placed to cover the issue.

We're in the process of assessing the situation and getting quotes from several companies. I am trying to determine if we have anything actionable here.

My  situation is as follows:  2 years ago a friend of mine asked me to move in with him at his leased house.  All the utilities were shut off and the house was a mess.  Like very bad.  I put all the bills aside from water in my name, and helped him(original tenant)clean the home. I found out now, after he moved out that he did not tell the landlord that I had moved in.  Now, after the original tenant moved out he left the house in a pretty nasty way.  Nothing majorly damaged but definitely not clean.  

I, not being on the lease, was waiting for a meeting with the landlord to see if I can stay maybe signing a new lease.  Today the landlord comes by and sees how much trash the original tenant left and how dirty the house and unkempt the landscaping is and says I have until Monday (2 days) to decide if I want to stay and give him a security deposit, and then increase the rent which would be due on the 1st of the month.  Our verbal agreement today stated that I would have to give him a cash security deposit on Monday, and then be on a month-to-month lease.  For this agreement I would also have to help clean the interior of the house, which I am fine with. 

One of my concerns is this month-to-month lease.  Do i have any protection from him just arbitrarily deciding he wants me out of the house one random month?

Another concern I have is if I sign this month-to-month lease, would I have to worry about the landlord trying trying shift the exterior cleanup responsibility to me without my knowing and try to keep my security deposit (which I haven't paid yet, it would be Monday if I decide to gi through with that course of action.) ?  He verbally stated that he would have people take care of it but I'm being cautious. 


I am also curious if I have any other recourse.   The landlord told me that I am technically a ""illegal squatter"" and that I basically have no right to any 30 day eviction notice.  Does anyone know if this is true?  Is there any other option for me besides moving out and scrambling to find a new place?

I can afford(barely) the security deposit and if I find a roommate I can afford the rent, but should I have to pay a whole security deposit when the house is in such a state?   

I'm just freaking out because of the social climate at the moment and I don't want to be scrambling around to find a new place to live before the 1st of September with a pandemic booming.

The law caps damages through small claims court at $1,000. I read through the contract thoroughly prior to signing, and it seemed fair at the time. But now, the defendant has offered a settlement of a little over $10,000. The contract with my attorney states:

""you will receive the first $1,000.00 of the total recovery. The remaining 
balance of the recovery will be our attorney’s fees and costs.""

I was never given a reason to expect the total settlement figure to be over $1,000, and my assumption was that the attorney's fees would be calculated and then charged to the defendant. Now, though, I'll only be receiving $1,000 and my attorney will receive $9,000. According to my attorney, the defendant won't agree to wording the settlement in any other way except that shows $10,000 going to me personally. This would make me liable for income tax greater than my actual recovery. 

I do want to make it clear that I don't suddenly feel entitled just because more money is on the table. I expected my attorney to make more than me in attorney's fees. But I definitely didn't expect 90%.

So my question: is this contract ethical, given the circumstances? Does the Florida Bar have any guidelines on this? My attorney specializes in this area of law and likely deals with this specific defendant regularly, and probably knew the settlement offer would be so high.

I was totally willing to get a roommate or do whatever necessary in order to catch up but to my LANDLORDS suggestion, I applied for “rent relief”

I was eventually approved (still waiting on the check) but for the few months we were waiting my landlord charged “late fees” of $400 per month. I am in Maine. I was fine to pay them because I figured I’m not paying rent in full out of my pocket, but now she is saying I owe her money for a month way back during the time I had lost my work. She is saying I owe her $800
For that month yet I gave her $400 in late fees for 3 months. After reading up on the law I now see that in Maine, a landlord cannot legally charge more than 4% of the rent for late a late fee (my rent is $1200 so that would equal about $50) so if she takes all the “late fees” she illegally accepted from me, it would cover the month that I missed.

In the lease it states she can charge me $30 A DAY that I am late. Yet the law says otherwise?

What is mine, or her, legal standing here. She keeps coming for me for this month all those months back but I dont know how to tell her the $400 she accepted from me 3 times was illegal and she should just apply it to the rent shes claiming I missed (just one month wasnt covered by rent relief, yet the $400 of late fees x 3 would cover that month). Is it worth fighting her on? I feel shes kind of being greedy at this point. I am otherwise caught up on my rent but to havw to go back and pay $800 plus the rent coming up again on the first would kind of put me out.

The rent relief paid 3 months of rent for the missed months.

There are 2 “errors” on the notice to quit and I am wondering if that makes it invalid/ or something I can bring up with management to help my cause. 

1) it’s says that I have “thirty (14) days” so which one is that? Obviously it’s an error on their part, so is that something?

2) it also only states my name on it and not my roommate. (For reference, I paid my half it is her who has not
Paid, but by the lease contract we are both 100% liable 

Quick story background my roommate moved out and apparently told the management a false story that they never followed up on but gave her the OK to leave but I was never informed until just now and the lease has not been changed so both our names are still on it

I actually am happy to move out because this place is toxic and I was planning on moving when my lease was up. But I am not happy or willing to pay her half of the rent being $2K. I’m feeling incredibly unfairly attacked and want to just get out of here.

11 years ago, I purchased a home with my then Fiance (yes, I know this was a HUGE mistake).  Less than two years after we bought the home, we had a set of twins, and then we separated, and my ex moved out. He refused to sell the house or sign a quick claim deed to get his name off.

For the last nine years I have been maintaining the home and have made significant upgrades which have increase the homes value. 

Early last year I refinanced the home mortgage loan into my own name. He signed for this to happen.  And he still remains on the deed. 

Now, I have purchased another home and listed the home that we have together. He agreed to selling it and told me that he would sign whenever he needs to sign and since he only lived in the home for less than 2 years, agreed to 22% of the sale proceeds. 

However, now that we have an offer which is much more than the listing price, he has completely changed his tune and has admitted that he is just trying to get more money than what we originally agreed to. 

Legally, how much of the equity is he entitled?  He has only lived in the home for less than 2 years, but I’m assuming it’s 50%, however I would like to be repaid before the proceeds are split for all of the upgrades that I have done which total between $16,000 and $17,000, if he try is entitled to 50%. 

He also feels that since he (sporadically) pays child support, he has been “paying towards the mortgage” and he contributed “towards the upgrades”, though these were done during the time he was not paying anything at all. 

I feel like I am living in crazy town right now and just need some unbiased advice.

I have not seen him in almost five years up until this May. Due to his past behavior, he doesn't really have any solid relationships with anyone. In May 2021, he suffered a stroke. I had not seen him in three years but was encouraged to check on him. I did, and it was clear he was not well. He went to the hospital for seven days and then to a nursing home for two weeks. I was told I would need to be guardian over him by the nursing home staff while he was there. During this time, my father was not in right state of mind. 

I filed and became temporary guardian. On his second week of being in the nursing home, he was discharged. His mental state returned ot his baseline and he was ambulatory. He cannot use his left arm, but he was almost back to normal. 

Due to my dad's mental state being baseline, this means he is back to be an abusive, manipulative, generally awful human being. 

I tell the court that he is back to his normal self, aside from the arm. They put in motion to get evaluations from medical professionals. This whole process has been going on since early June. 

After months of torment and verbal abuse, I tell the court I simply cannot be his guardian anymore. My own mental health is tanking, I'm in a constant state of distress, I need to be removed from this role so I can just block him and go back to my life and my family. The court tells me I simply cannot resign, that it must go to court. I plead with them to get a court date that is soon. 

I get my court date and its for August 18th, just this previous week. I show up at the time I'm told to show up and then I'm told that it was entered by mistake and that I will be issued a new court date. I am devastated. I call the guardianship person I have been working with and she tells me that if we can get the final evaluation, that she can just dismiss it without a court date.

I provide the paperwork to the final physician, his primary care physician, and they mark that he is fully disabled and requires guardianship. I am still devastated at this point. 

I don't know what my options are. He's stuck with guardianship. I'm stuck with him as his guardian. The court cannot give me a new date as of yesterday because it hasn't been entered yet. I don't know what to do. Is there a simple way for me to just flat out refuse to continue this role without being punished by the law? I joked with my wife that I might have her file for guardianship over me so I would be ineligible, but that joke doesn't seem so farfetched now, it would certainly be quicker.

I don't know what to do though, I need him out of my life. I need to be removed from this role. My mental health, my own well-being is deteriorating.

The place we are renting is the top two floors of a maisonette. While the bottom floor belongs to someone else. This neighbour ill refer to as the Pug. (I'll get to why later)

When we moved in the agency made it seem like the bottom floor was under renovation. We assumed no one lived there, there is also a lot of paper stuck to the windows and no door number. 

After a couple of days I stayed up in the living room (2nd floor) and was unpacking 1 box. It was fabric, I was just taking it out, folding it and moving it to another box. 
I was not being loud, maybe I dropped a pair of scissors at one point and that made noise but other than that I had no music playing or anything and I was sitting o  the sofa not moving much. 
At 3am (while folding fabric) i suddenly hear an aggressive ringing of the bell then hard beating on the door and it honestly scared me (my partner was asleep so I was alone) I answered the door and saw a guy looking figity and had his hood up, no light at all. The Pugin. I opened it slightly and he claimed to be my downstairs neighbour and he's been hearing alot of banging on the floor and I need to stop. At that time I appolagised and mentioned I was unpacking a box and that I would stop. He left and from that point and on I have been really careful not to make noise.

About a week or so after that my partner and I was folding laundry on the 3rd floor. Again, no music or anything. We finished and came down and sat on our sofa in our living room (we don't walk around in shoes just socks) 
Picked up the TV remote but before we could turn it on the most aggressive banging and ringing on the door, I thought it was gonna break my partner went to answer it while I stood out of site. The Pug was shouting and swearing about how we are ""taking the fucking piss"" and how ""every night your stomping around and it needs to fucking stop"" 
I peaked around the corner and he was squaring up my partner, that thing males do when theu want to look big. Widen their arms and shrink their neck. (This is why I call him the Pug) he was standing less than a foot away from my door and partner was clearly trying to intimidate him. I got terrified as I thiugh he was going to hurt my partner. I spoke up and said (at a calm level) ""we can't help it as we are only walking around our own home"" he looked up at me and left. I think he wanted my partner alone and didn't like that I was there. 
For reference this was at 9.20pm. 
Around the next few days he started to play loud bass music anytime we moved. And I mean yoy can't get a cup of water without it playing. It doesn't vibrate enough to make things move but its loud enough to keep my partner and i awake and to  irritate the hell out of us. 


Hw plays his music at completely diffrent times and sometimes when we haven't moved at all for atleast an hour. Like I've woken up to It or ill have headphones on and not be moving and he'll do it. He would also bang hard on the ceiling which made me scared of him. I started trying to tip toe slowly around but even that wasn't good enough. 

He admitted to someone that he is doing it to make us ""get the hint"" and that he turns it up on person to specificly spite us. 

After that aggressive knocking we installed a camera to watch our front door. He didn't come to our door again but he has been playing music and banging more. I have 1 video of my partner entering the house after work and less than a minute later the music can be heard on the footage. 
This day my partner stamped on the floor once in response. We were sick and tired and there was nothing we could do. He imedietly started hitting the floor repeatedly and shouted up ""come on then, come downstairs then"" a couple of times. We were scared to leave the house honestly all I could imagine was him attacking my partner. 

We phoned the non emergency line twice in this time. Once when the pug was at our door and the other he banged on the ceiling at 4.30 ish and woke my partner up. 

After a while of this we woke up one day to find our security camera hanging loose, we checked the footage and it was the pug with a stick trying to point it up but it swung down and faced him. Got a nice screenshot of his mug all shocked. 

We called the non emergency number and had a police officer come around. The lady on the line said ""even if its not damaged  the fact he knocked your camera loose on purpose counts as criminal damage"" 
When the police got here they said it didn't count as the camera was not damaged just knocked loose and there was nothing we could do about it. One of the officers just kept saying ""just move out"" ""I suggest you look for a new place to live"" 
They talked to the pug and he apparently told them that the last tenants were loud all the time, arguing and playing music constantly. So any time we made noise it triggered him and that he would stop bothering us. 

He did not

He also refused to give any of his details to the police. We also couldn't get any information on the property owner or tenant through any other means. 

He kept on with the music and banging and we called and complained to the council. They spoke to him and basicly told him if he has a problem with us then he should make a complaint to the council. 

Eventually we got a call from the police help line or something telling us not to bother calling as they are closing our case. The council gave us a form to fill out and record his behaviour but nothing has actually been done whatsoever. We called our agency and told them we feel unsafe in our own home. They basicly told us that we are stuck here till the end of our contract. 

To add more context. I work nights and my partner works days. When I come home at night I was naturally trying to be quiet as not to wake him. I would not be purposely stomping around. 

The police also told us if he knocks on our door aggressively again to call 999. (I'm in the uk)

My partner and I need advice on what to do.

I visited this place, liked it, and put in an application. At the time of application I was quoted $799 a month and told they would email me a link to sign the lease. 

At this point I didn't hear from them for weeks. I tried to make contact but I just couldn't contact them. I called, they wouldn't pick up. I left messages, they didn't call me back. I sent emails, never got a reply. I drove up to the building... and the office is locked up. I was eventually able to get in contact with someone a full month later. I was then told that the property had been sold to new owners and they had somehow lost all of my information except my name and my move-in date. I had to give them all my information again, and at this point they finally emailed me a link to sign the lease. The lease they emailed me had rent set at a full $100 above the price I had originally been told. In addition, the $150 admin fee was now $300. Despite being told there was no security deposit (and the website advertising it as a ""zero deposit"" apartment complex), there's also a $200 security deposit. 


I can't exactly back out of it now. I gave my current apartment my 30 day notice and I believe they're already found someone to replace me as soon as my move-out day comes. So it's looking like my options are to pay the extra rent, or end up homeless.

1st.  We have not be served with the proper papers.  Just a threat from our landlord.

Backstory.  We moved into this place 3 years ago. We have complained about the water drainage and the leaks along the outside walls, the whole time.

2 months ago, sewer back up into our bathroom.  After a day of trying to get a hold of our landlord.  He sends the plumbers over.  They do the job, tell him he has to replace our toilet and the sewage line from our bathroom to the main.  Three days later he is trying to make us pay for the plumber's bill.  

Meanwhile ceiling tiles are falling down, because of the leaks from the roof.

A week ago, another sewer backup.  This time we got codes involved.  Because our landlord would not answer our calls.  Plumbers come, he threatens us with charging more rent, because its our fault the sewage is backing up (even though we had told him it was a issue since we moved in). Of course he ignores the ceiling falling in.

Yesterday he comes by, ""You will be out in 30 days, I rented your place already.  I'll bring the paperwork tomorrow""

When we went to codes, they warned us he might try this.  Years ago, I went through an eviction.  I know where I live, a county official serves the paperwork, not the landlord.

I would really like some advice on this one. 

My mom married my stepdad, a Vietnam veteran who was battling cancer, diabetes, and had terrible heart issues, 25 yrs ago in a small Mississippi town. They were actually married at a courthouse and my mom has the marriage certificate. Throughout their marriage my mom tended to his daily needs, cooking and cleaning for him. He was very sickly and had a very bad heart. He also had cancer. Diabetes. High blood pressure. 

He eventually went blind in one eye. 

During their marriage my mom was introduced to his entire family. All of brothers and sisters. His children even knew her too. 

My mom was also his transport to and from Memphis, TN to his multiple medical appointments at the VA hospital. Elderly herself, she would drive the one HR and 30 minute drive each way to transport him and she sat with him at his appointments and advocated for him to have the best treatment possible. 

Throughout this time he would often tell us that no matter what happened to him our mom would be taken care of because of how she had cared for him. 

He was also very good to her. 

Well, he passed away in heart surgery. 

His only living brother, that my mom had known for years, lied to my mother like there was a will. He said he wanted the house to go to his adult children who never cared to even visit him. They have no clue where the house is even at. They live in Chicago. Hes had the house for maybe 40 years. 

My mom relied on all the information she was given by the younger brother. 

My stepdad was 73 at the age of death. My mom is 70. 

I kept telling my Mom to go to court and file as executor of the estate when he first passed. She allowed his brother to handle everything. 

The brother told my mom that she would be allowed to live in the house for the remainder of her years. I told my mom that she was at least entitled, as the surviving spouse, to a portion of the house, which again is in Mississippi. 

To make a long story short. The kids who are all grown now are claiming he abandoned them and because he was still married to his first wife and never told my mother - they are rushing to sell the house and kick her out with nothing. She just found out he was married when she applied for the social security benefits. 

The kids who never cared to visit him in all that time (40 yrs) and who dont even know where the house is at are putting her out. 

She also cannot get his survivor benefits from the VA because again he was still married to his first spouse. 

BUT..the first spouse passed a few days ago. 

So now it's his kids against my mom. 

My mom has called a few attorneys and they have said because Mississippi doesnt recognize common law marriage (since her real marriage was not valid due to his bigamy) she will get nothing.

I am a college student currently starting my Junior Year. About halfway through Freshman year, I went out to a club and lost my phone. The next morning I called the venue, they found nothing, and it was dead so wouldn't show up on Find My IPhone. I eventually got a new one, and considered the lost phone stolen or gone. This was almost 2 years ago.

Today, I accidentally misplaced the phone I got when the other one went missing, and was going to use Find My IPhone to play a sound. When I was searching for my devices, I found that not only was my lost IPhone online, but the location was on, and it was being used only a few minutes prior. I have a couple of questions.

1. The phone is about an hour and a half away in a different state. I have a car, and it would be easy to get there if I wanted. It is appearing at a summer camp, and I believe it was stolen and resold, and the person using it currently has no idea and likely isn't dangerous. Should I drive out and confront them, or contact the local police out there and work with them? What would the police be able to do, and how could I prove that it is my phone?
2. None of my accounts have been accessed or used fraudulently since that phone went missing. I believe the person is using the phone as their own but for some reason my Apple ID is still logged in, or my phone is at least still trackable. I don't want to put it in lost mode because I don't want them to panic and turn off the location. Is this a good move?
3. I looked up the dates of the camp and from what I can tell, it is no longer in session, meaning anybody there right now is probably part of staff or administration. Would it be worth it to call the camp and explain the situation?",legaladvice,Lost Phone From Almost 2 Years Ago Just Popped Up on Find My IPhone,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8snaf/lost_phone_from_almost_2_years_ago_just_popped_up/

My parents are upset that they do not get to see our child as much as they want to due to some abusive and controlling behaviors that they have had since our child was born. 

They started to become controlling during her pregnancy and forced us to accept gifts from them even though we kept refusing them. We mostly trusted them during this time but we were hesitant that they would use these acts as hostage taking behavior if they did not get their way in the future and would talk about how they did these things for us. 

The next major event that occurred was when our son was spitting up alot as a infant. My mother saw this, insisted that he was lactose intolerant and went to the store bought soy formula and tried to force us to use that instead of his regular formula and told her to stop breastfeeding him. He isn't lactose intolerant we just had to switch the formula type from Similac Premature to Similac sensitive. Unfortunately their behavior got worse from here. 

My parents are both smokers and while they smoke outside they would wear the same clothes they smoked in and try to hold our son. We raised this safety concern with them and suggested that they wear a jacket when they smoke so the residue was not on their clothes when they were holding our baby. My father outright refused to comply and at this point we were uncomfortable with taking him over to their house. 

My fiance is African American and I am Caucasian and my parents were extremely against us dating when we starting going out over 10 years ago in high school. My mom told me that dating her was ""just as bad as being gay"" and my Father would end arguments with ""At least I'm not dating an N word"". My fiance had concerns about their past racist behavior as our sons skin tone is closer to hers than mine and when we brought this up after being reluctant to let them see him they went off. They threatened to call CPS on us and threatened to file for grandparents rights. After this they were not welcome in our home and we would bring our son over to my grandparents house once a month or two for them all to see him. 

After this they kept trying to talk us into going over to their house with him and every time we would refuse they would bring it up again like the previous conversation never happened. My brother recently passed away and they asked if we were going to take him to the funeral viewing. We were reluctant to do so because of COVID and RSV but we told them we would if we could avoid large crowds of people with him. My mother picked him up at the funeral and walked up to crowds of freaking people with him to show him off with everyone being unmaked. We got home from the funeral already irritated at them about this and we got our mail to see that they are indeed taking us to court for visitation or custody rights over our son. 

A point about the formula incident that I would like to bring up is that they are continuing the abuse they did to me with my son. I have Cerebral Palsy and while it doesn't affect me now my parents used it as a way to get attention when I was younger. They took me to doctors and said I had cognitive delays until the doctor agreed and then enrolled me in special education classes. Despite being enrolled in special education classes in high school I was able to get a BS in Biology, an 84th percentile MCAT score,  and have had an interview at a medical school already this cycle. People I have talked to about this have said that this was clearly abuse and that if I could do that well in college and in my MCAT that I should have never been enrolled in special education classes. 

I am not worried about custody but I am for visitation. My fiance and I do not smoke or do drugs and I switched from alcohol to nonalcoholic beer when he was born. He has never been abused and shows secure attachment with us. He will go explore his environment and come back to us when he wants to be held and is happy to see both of us when we come home from work. His pediatrician is completely in our corner and is going to back us up in court and my fiance is a peds nurse but we are still worried because anything can happen in court.

In a nutshell, I'm a UK-based remote worker with a U.S. company. It's a tiny start-up that owns some media outlets. 

I started on a freelance, per-article writer basis. I was then promoted, with a contract offering me a monthly salary, plus per-article pay. Tbh, I wasn't doing much for the salary and eventually figured out why they were paying it - to keep me from going elsewhere as my writer traffic is insanely high.

The company recently got screwed over by a partner, making everyone take cuts. They slashed my income 65% (halved the salary and reduced my publishing quota by 75%). 

I've gingerly been asking if things will improve. They have very few answers for me - except recently telling me they ""plan to move away from salary"" in the long-term and go with incentivized per-article pay. What.the.fuck.

FYI, that's pay-per-view where you shit your pants every month wondering how much you'll make.

I have a contractor agreement with a salary in black-and-white.

They told me this ""plan"" to shift oh-so-casually, like it was no big deal.

I am a UK citizen. At the moment I don't believe my real identity is known, but it would not be difficult to find under discovery during the case.

I anonymously made contact with the lawyer, and have been negotiating a settlement. They have suggested a figure that I would be willing to pay to prevent me from being taken to court. I have marked all communication 'without prejudice'.

I assume once we reach agreement on the figure, I will be issued with a settlement agreement laying out the terms.

What should I expect to see in this agreement? Is there any specific wording that it needs to contain to ensure it will completely end the matter and their client couldn't sue me again for the same infringement? I am expecting it to contain my agreement to cease and desist, their agreement to release me from this and any future lawsuit relating to this matter, and an agreement to keep the details of the settlement confidential.

Are there any clauses I should look out for that I should not accept for any reason? (i.e. do these law firms ever try to trick people into signing agreements that leave them exposed further? I assume given the volume of lawsuits they generate and the number of defendants on each one, they will have a template agreement that I would hope would be reasonable and fair.)

If the agreement contains a clause where I specifically admit to the infringement, should I be concerned or is that to be expected? Should I instead look to state that I don't admit liability or would that be unrealistic? (The evidence they have presented to me isn't really disputable)

Am I right in assuming I will be required to abandon my anonymity in order to sign the agreement, and provide my full name and address? Is there any risk in doing this, if this is the case?

Is there any risk that if they have all of my personal details as a result of settlement negotiations, these details could be used against me? For example could they abandon settlement discussions having obtained my details and then use these in the pending lawsuit? Would it be reasonable to expect them to sign the agreement first, so that it becomes legally binding as soon as I sign it?

I was leaving my residence at 6:45am. I was in a 2017 Honda Civic. I was driving down a residential road, coming up to a stop sign that led onto a busier street. There is a school on the street corner. Due to this school, a Houston police officer was directing traffic at the intersection. I waited approximately 30 seconds before the officer directing traffic stood in front of a line of waiting cars, obstructing their passage, and explicitly waved me forward to proceed. I pulled out and looked both ways so that I could make a left-hand turn onto the street. 

Then, while passing through the intersection, I was hit by a Dodge Ram. My airbags deployed and I got banged up all the way up my left side. Bruises, bleeding, etc. Before I was able to get out of the car, I heard the officer yelling at the other driver that he should have slowed down because he was in a school zone. After the collision, the other driver came over and profusely apologized to me. I was towed to a nearby gas station. 

A different police officer responded to the scene. Her first action as soon as she arrived, before getting either side's story, was to walk up to me and tell me, ""hey accidents happen, but you were at fault here. He had the right-of-way."" I proceeded to inform her that I was waved forward and given clear instruction to proceed at the stop sign. Her response to that was, ""oh well you can't go left at that stop sign anyway. So you're at fault."" I should add that there are no signs saying you can't turn left. The only sign at that intersection is a stop sign. People turn left there all day. 

She then went over to the other driver (a young guy whose parents and girlfriend had shown up by this point to comfort him because he was just oh so distraught). All the while he kept apologizing. Apologizing means nothing. It doesn't determine fault. So in the end, I was given two citations while the other driver was given nothing. 

My two citations are:

1. Disregarding a stop sign. (My counter to this is: I was stopped at that stop sign for roughly 30 seconds before going, I had to because the traffic was such that I could not have gone without the officer stopping traffic and giving me explicit instruction to proceed).
2. Failure to yield at an intersection. (My counter to this is: I feel that once the officer directing traffic had stopped oncoming traffic and given me instruction to go, I have the right-of-way. The other driver tried to go around the waiting cars and that is how the accident happened).

The officer that responded to the accident didn't ask me one question about what happened. She spent significant time talking to the other guy. She gave me two citations that were not based on what actually happened. I definitely stopped at that stop sign for a significant amount of time before going. So, if nothing else, the ticket for ""disregarding the stop sign"" should be dismissed. 

I'm in the process of talking to my insurance company. His insurance keeps trying to get me to talk to them. But I haven't responded to their calls. I have a court date for October 26, 2021 on the citations. I feel I have grounds to fight the tickets. 

My insurance is in the process of gathering all the relevant information. But I am going to fight these tickets. If I am able to show that he was clearly at fault, then I believe his insurance is the one that should pay out.

Questions: 

1. Does an officer waving me forward at a stop sign, while simultaneously stopping oncoming traffic, give me the right-of-way in this situation?
2. Should I ignore his insurance company's attempts to reach me?
3. Does him apologizing profusely give me any ammunition when it comes to determining fault?
4. Is there anything I can do about this officer that wrote the two citations while not asking me a single question about what happened? I have the name and badge number of the responding officer. I have the name of the officer that directed traffic but I still need to get her badge number too.

Very long story short there is a 17 year old child who works for me.  There is a long history of heavy mental abuse with this child’s parents.  It’s gotten physical a few times.  Father is a drug addict, mother is bi-polar and refuses to take meds.  There is no other family alive.

We’ve done everything to help this child legally.  DCF has been contacted, reports are written and they are sent right back to the parents.  As one attorney told me, unless there is overt evidence of physical abuse such as broken bones or accusations of sexual abuse there isn’t anything DCF or anyone can do.  “Being emotionally abusive isn’t illegal.”

My wife and I are at our wits end.  We’ve tried working things out with her parents, we tried the school/cops/DCF.  This child is suffering.  They are barely eating, highly under weight, not sleeping, etc 

The original plan was to do an adult adoption once they hit 18.  But that is 11 months away and this poor child is hurting.  I don’t know how else to help them.  Their parents failed them, the “system” failed them and now I’m failing them.

So what if they just leave?  And come stay with my wife snd I?  Our house is two counties away from their parent’s house.  Their classes are remote and they finish highschool at the end of September so school wouldn’t be an issue.  They already have 30 something college credits thanks to dual enrollment so getting into college shouldn’t be affected once they turn 18.

What kind of charges would we be facing?  The only thing I could find was harboring a runaway §985.731 and/or delinquency of a minor.  Both carry the same sentence but I’m sure there are others.  I own my own business so I’m not really worried about getting fired/losing my income if I were to be arrested. I’m just trying to determine the risks involved.

So I told them I wouldn't be able to interview the day they wanted, but here were my next available dates and times for the next week even offering a weekend day. The interviewer schedules it for my first available time. All of the exchanges were done through email.

Moot to the legalities, but the reason they learned about my situation, there was one red flag with the quick and sudden interview. The other red flag was after they scheduled the interview, they sent an email asking me to accept the calendar invite and then said, ""You sound like you have a busy schedule! Are you sure you can even work full time? This is a full time position."" At this point, considering my unique situation, I felt it best to tell them of my situation.

My aunt works for an employer who has an onsite apartment attached that she lives in. They dock employee pay in half for the rent. She’s had issues the last three years with the owners not wanting to fix any issues. The owners always says the rules don’t apply and they won’t fix the issues because they’re a “non profit and private commercial business”. Which private yeah, but non profit is a big fat lie.  

My aunts TV recently caught fire but she was able to put it out in time. The outlet it was plugged into was charred and melted but the cord to the TV was undamaged. The  TV manufacturer told her the copper strip inside the tv became so hot somehow that it caught the lower right corner on fire. She found out the next day that none of the outlets were grounded and the wiring to the entire building is unsafe, maintenance told her as well as a local electrician who walked off the job because of how bad the wiring was vs owner being cheap.

Nobody can touch the outside water spigot or the upstairs bathroom sink faucet without an electrical shock. She knows that the electrical cable from the meter to the house is damage, the damage is exposed and sometimes when it rains you can hear a low electrical buzz.

The siding of the apartment is full of holes with visible rotted wood and insulation that clearly has mold on it. My aunt’s bedroom is right on the other side and the smell from the mold is horrible inside her room. 

Another issue she has is, the upstairs and downstairs temperature in the winter time is greatly different. There’s only one thermostat downstairs that controls the entire apartment. She can’t turn it above 75 in the winter because her children sleep upstairs in those bedrooms and it’s gets so hot. She’s proven the temperature issues by using two baby monitors that record temperatures. The upstairs one constantly stays the temperature the thermostat is set (usually 70-72) but her room downstairs is 55 degrees with a space heater on for extra heat when it’s in the 30s outside. The owner  she showed only chuckled and told her buy a sleeping bag made for lower temps. 

There is only one shared commercial water heater and because the business is like a bed and breakfast and has a full kitchen the water heater is set at 170 degrees. She’s been burned many times, some blistering after one time, while showering if a guest flushes a toilet, kitchen runs the dishwasher, sink running. Owner can’t turn it down due to sanitation codes she was told.

The car functioned as expected until May 2021. One day, we noticed that one of the center console displays was off. Then when we tried to close the car with the key fob, it didn't work either. The car would only open/close manually and upon opening, the car alarm goes off until the car is started. Some of the inside car lights don't work. 

We took the car to the Subaru dealership and they diagnosed the issue as a 10A backup fuse which was blown. They told us that usually something else in the car causes this fuse to go out but they had tested the components and nothing seemed to be wrong. So maybe it was just a faulty fuse. They replaced it and the car worked as expected for about a month. All the work was done under warranty since the car was at ~31.5k miles. 

After a month, the same issue re-occurred. We took the car to the Subaru dealership again and this time they had it for two weeks. They said that they tested around 400 codes associated with that fuse. They even asked for permission and we agreed to have their shop foreman drive the car home and to work for a day or two to see if he could figure it out. They still didn't come up with anything and replaced the fuse again. Once again, the car worked as expected for 1 month and yesterday the problems came back.

A few more factors...This is an official Subaru dealership where we are getting the work performed, but it is not the same dealership where we purchased the car. Also, at the time that the issue occured the car was 31.5k miles but we are now just over the warranty mileage at 36k (two long road trips in the last couple months, both without issue at the time).

During that call, someone joking asked, ""So we shouldn't go and buy stock in this new company because that would be insider trading, right?"" The owner's response was basically, ""Well, *you* can buy some, but don't tell your friends about it.""

This rubbed me the wrong way, so I did some reading. The [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp) article explains it pretty well, but it does confuse me a bit about how people insider trade ""legally"" if they ""disclose it publicly."" The owner of the company says that this deal, if it goes through, will be on CNBC and discussed on Fox Business. I don't doubt that, so with that being said, I feel that:

1. I do have knowledge of the (potential) sale before the public would have it.
2. That does potentially influence my decision to buy stocks because when news breaks of this sale the stock price will likely rise.

My gut feeling is no, but if I can do so legally and it's a smart investment, I'd at least like to know I have the option.

Thank you so much in advance for all your advice!

QUESTION 
How do I waive $7000 charge for a false alarm charge in Victoria Australia?

CONTEXT 
Our apartment completely flooded with accidental fire sprinkler discharge the other day. 

It was very stupid of us, but we had hanged a house plant hook on a fire sprinkler not knowing what fire sprinkler looked like.

I’m a migrant and back home fire sprinkler looks different, so had no idea what fire sprinkler in Australia looked like (dumb I know…) and thought this strange thing on a ceiling was a decorative hang hook for plants, lamp shade etc 

Now I’ve read up on what happened (straight after the flood I didn’t even understand the coloration between the two as I literally had no idea what fire sprinkler was) since I come from a country where I never encountered it looking like that.  

Anyways, I’ve taken plant off the hook to water it, and left my window open and went to my bedroom. This ignorance was very very costly… Now we are homeless with no belongings that’s not damaged. I regret it so much. 

My housemate was also in her bedroom and we hear this water noise in the lounge room, we found fire sprinkler going off (water pressure was wild!) and flooded the whole apartment and even water damaged common areas and floored beneath us.

We rushed out to the building entrance and building manager called the fire department and three fire brigade came. They stopped the water and sucked out most of the water but most of our belongings and the apartment is damaged.

Now me and my housemate are temporary homeless. Our phone is literally all we have.

All my work in computer, alongside work equipment is gone too. I’m staying at my friends and I don’t even have spare clothes as content insurance restorer took all my belongings to dry.


I thought this was already an nightmare.
But today building manager have sent us an email saying that we have 21 days to write a letter to fire department with a ‘reasonable response to waive $7000 fine for false fire alarm charge’


It asked ‘details of why the false alarm was not preventable or foreseeable’ and they may or may not charge us. We have 21 days to write this letter.

The report states that ‘occupants accidentally broke sprinkler head by butchers hook to hang items from sprinkler head’ which is true but wind moved the hook while we were absent. Hook must have moved with wind and damaged the glass bolb in sprinkler.


I feel utterly stupid.
But I didn’t know that this was fire sprinkler so this was a very innocent and not at all an malicious act. I still understand that we caused a huge inconvenience and feel horrible.

I have worked so hard to deposit to this apartment but I have less than $1000 in my bank left and I’ve recently lost work in COVID-19. And even my computer is broken and I’m a full time student with poor parents so I’m very worried of having to pay $7k… I am not in a position to make a lot of money in this pandemic.

Q1. Could anyone please give me advice on how to write a letter to waive fee?
Q2. I have Anz home owner content insurance with ‘accidental cover’ will my contents be covered under this situation? 

We simply can’t afford it and are very distressed.
Any advice will be greatly appreciated

So back when I was in high school (Canada), I had some altercations with my fellow classmates (I was constantly being bullied by them because I didn't get along with my home room teacher, so he encouraged them to make fun of me) as well as various other teachers; and in the heat of moment I threatened to sue the school publicly in class if they don't stop the harassments. 
One of the teacher, back then was promoted to vice principal not too long before when the incident took place, was involved in the incident. Fearing that he might lose his promotion; under the approval of the admins of the school, he hired a lawyer to deal with me. Being a stupid teenager, I thought the school was just messing with me and there wasn't any real lawyer involve, I kept arguing with teachers and fellow classmates in school and they (teachers/students) tricked me into revealing personal information that will help them with their cases against me and had other student secretly recording everything I said. 

I lived in a upper-middle class neighborhood back then, and some of the students' parents are quite influential in the area, and allot of them assisted the school with the case (for example, one of the student's parent is a relatively high rank police officer and she used her parent's influence to gather private information about me and provided them to the school, they even tricked/threatened me into giving false confession on tape while in class). I was even tricked into arguing with a local judge (whose son had classes with me before). The important thing to note here is that, most of my classmates and their parent never directly argued with me in classes, rather, they asked the teacher to represent them when talking to me. And in the heat of argument, I did use many terms and words that might be consider offensive and even discriminatory (though I don't actually mean it in anyway). 

One thing lead to another, after collecting enough evidences against me, the lawyer told me (through the teacher) that I incriminated myself, and they have collected enough evidences about me that police could charge me as criminal if they wish to, and shall I showed up in court, I will be tried as an adult (I was only 16 at the time). Back then I thought they were just trying to scare me, and I didn't bother tell my parents about it, they were never aware of what happen in school.

I don't know the details of exactly what any one of them did and how credible what the lawyer said was, but the incident has been bothering me for awhile. So my questions is, is it possible for a minor to be tried as adult in cases like this?

First let me state this happened last fall - so I realize time may be running out or already run out, but I'd like to know regardless.

We brought out a contractor to look at our house (in Colorado) to put new gutters on. We had a basic quote and were going over the formalities and we were all set to hire them. While he was on the roof he noted a lot of hail damage (we did have a big hail storm a few months prior and many houses had to have roofs replaced). He told us about the amount of damage per square foot he saw and that it exceeded insurance requirements for a new roof. Based on what we were seeing with everyone else getting new roofs we had no reason to doubt it. He told us to contact our insurance company to have them come out and that he'd be there when they are and he assured us we'd be able to get a new roof.  I've dealt with leaky roofs before and I didn't want to chance it so we contacted our insurance company. They came out and found NO roof damage other than some cosmetic damage on some vents. But the damage was done - it was considered a claim on our insurance record. They estimated the cosmetic damage to be $3200 and with a $2700 deductible they cut us a $500 check. This is not work that HAS to be done and we would NEVER have filed a claim for something so small. Now if there is a real roof claim in the future they will deduct that previous claim from any damage and we will have to effectively pay another deductible. So basically this contractor cost us $2700 on our next repair (should we need it). But it also counts as a strike on our insurance record. That is what really pissess me off. We have never filed a claim in 20 years. But hail storms are a problem where we live and while one more claim won't be the end of things, a third one would get our insurance terminated. So I'm pretty miffed that this guy lied to us (I had no idea what he thought he was going to accomplish).Needless to say we did not hire him to do our gutters (and they have not been done to date). So my question is - do I have any legal recourse against the contractor we did not hire? (The damage being a strike on our insurance record and a double hit on a deductible).

&amp;#x200B;

Note: the 'contractor' was a medium sized company and the guy who talked us into the claim was one of many field workers. I looked into filing a small claims but in my state I have to serve the registered agent and I can't find one listed on our states SOS website.

&amp;#x200B;

Also note, to date we  have not cashed the insurance check, even though that makes no difference to our strike status. We also had a third party come out to look at our roof and they backed up the assessment that there was no roof damage. Both this company and the adjuster said our roof looks like it has another 40 years (a 50 year roof was put on before we moved in 8 years ago... due to a hail storm).",legaladvice,Can I sue a contractor I didn't hire.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8o2zm/can_i_sue_a_contractor_i_didnt_hire/

My husband and I have found ourselves in a bit of a pickle. I'm going to break down the information to make it easier to understand. Additionally, my husband and I will be seeking professional legal advice next week, I'm just posting here to get and idea of what our options may be. Thank you!

[ Information Provided by Dealership ]

Located in Oahu, Hawaii.

2011 Mini Cooper Countryman, about 69k miles, used. Purchased on June 24th.

Car was priced at $9,995, we put $6,000 down and financed the rest. Due to my husband and I having young credit, we have a 19% interest rate :/

The dealership did say the car was in an accident with the previous owners, but the dealership stressed the fact that the car was COMPLETELY rebuilt by the previous insurance and was safe to drive. They very quickly mentioned the car rolled in the accident, but then reiterated that the car was rebuilt. Nothing else was said about the vehicle, no carfax or anything was provided in regards to the cars past.

[ How Damage Was Discovered ]

I took the car out for a drive. Was stopped at a 4-way stop with a speed bump at the stop sign. When I pulled forward from my stop, my passenger side back tire/shock made a loud noise. I immediately knew something was wrong and drove it to the nearest mechanic. The mechanic inspected the vehicle and initially quoted us $570 for a back-right strut replacement. 

We paid and the part was ordered, but a few days later we received a call from the mechanic saying they could not complete the job, would be refunding us the money, and advised we take the car to a body shop. He stated that when going to repair the strut, absolutely nothing was lining up, the bolts were bent and that indicated to him we had a bent frame.

Since that call the car has been sitting while we wait for legal advice.

[ My thoughts ]

My husband and I are young, this was our first car we purchased so I expected we would make mistakes. Our worry is that we will be stuck with a car that is essentially totalled, we don't have the money to constantly repair the vehicle. 

I don't know what/if the dealership is responsible for anything. Absolutely nothing was mentioned about the frame being bent or damaged when purchasing the car. It was extremely unsafe for my husband and I to be driving. We're lucky we were not in an accident or anything because obviously the cars structural integrity is (pardon my french) shit. The fact that going over a speed bump at &gt;5mph caused a broken strut says a lot.

Ideally we would get our money back on the vehicle or do an equal trade in value. But I'm not sure if that's even an option?

At the beginning of the week, my boyfriend and I told our roommates that we would be finding a subletter for our room and would be moving out as we found our own apartment. So you all have some background, we are moving out because they constantly disrespect our belongings. I have been very generous to provide a lot of the pots and pans and appliances in the kitchen and they have constantly mistreated them. While we were moving our stuff, I took my expensive toaster that they have ruined, and tossed it as well as cutting the cord so it couldn’t be used again. This caused one of our roommates to message us and call us “petty.” After my boyfriend decided to exchange some messages with him telling him to calm down and it was our toaster so we could do what we wanted with it, our roommate threatened him and said “if you ever fucking come back here it’ll be so fucking bad for you bro you don’t even understand.” We assume he said this because he was under the impression we didn’t live there anymore when we were in fact still on the lease. We told him this. Well, we saw him when we went back for our last things and didn’t interact. In one of the instances I stepped out, I noticed my car was completely keyed on the hood. I asked if he did it and of course denied it. I also suspect it was him because after I discovered the scratches, there was a camera in his bedroom window pointed at his car that was not there upon our arrival to the house. I also called the landlords and they said he shouldn’t have that there since it’s a privacy issue and to contact the authorities.

I went to a doctor over the course of probably 18 months for a recurring cough- visiting at least once a month during that time.  No tests, no xrays- nothing was ever done except for pushing antiobiotics. 

Ended up having massive fluid build up around my heart, needing heart surgery, and finding a mass in my chest as well. 

The cough was a symptom of both the fluid build up and the mass- both of which, if caught 18 months earlier, would have been significantly less severe, or possibly not even an issue.

\- Agreed upon closing date was 7/12/21

\- Addendum on contract: ""$10,000 credit to be given, in lieu of repairs, and occupancy permit provided.""

\- Closing date passed, no extension was put out there.  The occupancy permit was not available by the closing date, as repairs for this were being done, and the city of St. Louis took some time to inspect the property.

**Is the contract active, given the closing date of 7/12/21 has passed? We both signed an inspection notice resourse.  My realtor tells me that he BELIEVES this acts to keep the contract current, but Ive heard from other parties that since the closing date has passed, the contract doesn't hold any obligation to either party to move forward.**

As the seller, I had to do $6,300 of repairs in order for the property to pass inspection, for the occupancy permit.  Therefore, I wanted to negotiate the ""$10k credit"" since costly repairs were done.  The buyer said absolutely not.  Therefore, I do not wish to go through with the deal.  The buyer is now threatening a ""Breach of contract"" lawsuit against me.

A month ago, I was facing some financial issues and I was approached by someone who said they could help me. I was facing eviction because my funds have run dry due to a medical bill and I knew it was crazy to listen to a random person off of the internet but I risked it. He asked what was the situation in which I explained what the problem was. He told me he and his wife wanted to help with my situation. He suggested that I use Paypal but the way he had was very unusual. He gave me his banking account username and password and wanted me to link that to my Paypal. He then wanted me to send money using that bank to one other person he listed and they would send money back. I was a bit suspicious but since I didn't have my cards connected. I attempted to follow what he was saying but my Paypal had issues processing the transaction that caused a 7-day hold. After seeing that didn't work, he then asked about my bills. I told him it was mostly rent so I handed him my login to my resident portal. I received an email saying that my rent entirely was paid, which then had me less suspicious. He then told me that he only wanted to give me 500 so I just pay back the rest. We were using WhatsApp which he called and said that. He told me I could pay it back over time and understood that I was dealing with a hardship.

5 hours later he bombarded me with messages saying he needed the money paid back asap. Rushing me to repay it. I'm the type of person who wanted to repay the debt that I owe someone so I tried to get the money back to him. I didn't like how he did a complete 180 but the fact he paid my rent, I felt like I had an obligation.  The guy kept on and on through hours of the night and day and I asked him about what he said earlier. He just kept going on for about 3 days. I was able to get the money to repay back what I owe and I thought it was the end. He said we were good but then he offered a way for me to make money. He suggested I could find other people who needed bills to be paid and I get a cut from the payment. I told him no thanks because the way he acted with me in terms of trying to get the money repaid really put a sour taste in my mouth but at least I was done with him, right?

He then approached me again saying his wife was upset that he donated 500 and she wanted to donate only 200. He suggested an idea of using the bank account that's still linked to my Paypal to send the payment to the account he said to send it to. ( It was still linked because if I removed it, Paypal would have put a hold on my account for a missing ""payment"" from what the Paypal folks had said)So I did the two transactions and I questioned why he had different accounts instead of one? He didn't answer but instead kept asking about the progress of the transfer, rushing me as he did before. After that was done, I had received several messages from him where he demanded I respond to his messages. I didn't see them at the time because I was at the doctor's.  He then started to threaten that he would take back the rent he paid. I told him he crossed the line when he threatened me despite the fact I finished repaying him back. I blocked him and thought it was the end because the payment he made was fully processed and I thought there was no way for him to get his payment back right? Regardless I waited till the hold was removed from my Paypal account and removed his bank. I changed my login information for my place so he won't get in it again and try something else crazy.

A couple of days ago, my leasing office informed me that my payment was returned. which incurred a fee and a late fee on top of that. I told them the situation and they waived the late fee charged because they were puzzled about how payment was returned. They gave me some extra time to have it resolved which I took care of.  From what they told me, they told me that the payment was unauthorized. Since the guy took back his payment I charged back my payments towards him since I did it through Zelle (since Paypal had a hold on it) I dunno if I would get it back but I'm hoping. Speaking of Paypal, I found my account was limited because the guy also said the previous transactions were unauthorized. While I was talking to a representative, they said that they will not remove the limitation because they needed a bank statement from the guy saying it was authorized...I told them that the guy scammed me and I had screenshots of proof he authorized it. I explained the situation and offered to show screenshots and a chat log of what I had with the guy but they kept saying they need a bank statement from his bank still and if I didn't, I would incur a negative balance of what has been processed which I had to pay. If I didn't pay it would go to the collection while my Paypal will remain permanently limited and if I try to make another account, it will get limited as well.

Is there a way I can try to resolve this and what other steps do I need to make? I am mainly worried because of the fact he paid my rent, he saw my full name and the exact location of where I am at. It had me a bit paranoid because today there was a random U-Haul truck that was in front that nobody claimed and from what I heard, the U-Haul and brought to help someone move out.

I come to realize that this is probably some kind of scam because of a few things:

\-The guy had a number starting with 719 which I know that's the area code for Colorado Springs.  but when he tried to get me to use Amazon to buy some gift cards for a hotel (I didn't do it) he gave me the address of a place in New York which is a vacant apartment room that's is up for rent. I want to say the name he gave is a dead name but it was on his bank account. I don't know much about banks but I do know he had a JPMorgan account that is international. I do know that he does speak English very clearly but from the accent, he had an Indian accent.

\- He had multiple Paypal accounts, 4 of them alongside 4 Venmo Accounts, 3 Zelle Accounts. and he never had me send money to the same account.",legaladvice,(GEORGIA) I was scammed by someone who helped me with a bill who chargeback his payment after I repaid what I owed them.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8mtxi/georgia_i_was_scammed_by_someone_who_helped_me/

It was supposed to be simple. I bought a cable for my husky and put him in the back yard. All my roommate had to do was give him food and water. 3rd day I was here he sent me a picture of my dog in a cage with his eyes looking pretty messed up. Roommate said he hurt them trying to get out of the cage, and he was going to take him to the vet. He said he brought him in and put him in the cage to get him out of the rain, even though he was supposed to pick up a dog house for me that I was going to pay him back for. (I work third shift and didn't have time off to stay up during the day and get one myself). Anyways, that was fine. Next thing I know, he's messaging me saying my dog bit him, he had to get stitches and the cops showed up at the house over my dog. Then he told me the police took him and had him put down, and he was kicking me out. In the middle of the night he messaged me again saying my dog was alive in the back yard, slowly dying, something attacked him in the yard (he supposedly never left the cage and I believe the ""something"" that attacked him was my roommate, as I've been warned he has major anger issues, which I've now seen by how ugly he's been acting this while time). I was prepared to get a flight back to Kentucky to try anything I could to save my dog, when I got a call from my roommate's cousin who's a vet, saying my boy didn't make it. Next morning, my roommate messaged me again to say my dog is alive and in a pound. I finally had enough and went the hell off on him, and now he's saying the locks are changed, all my stuff is in the yard, I'll never see my dog again, he's going to make sure I end up in jail, he's going to sue me for the dog bite and abandoning my dog, and he's saying the rent I paid before I left for Florida was the previous months rent (it wasn't). I'm not on any lease and I've only been there for a few months, but I'm pretty certain he can't do any of this legally. I'm going back to Kentucky tomorrow morning.

They also named me executor of their estate in their will.  

I stupidly, yes, signed the trust documents without fully understanding them because I do trust my parents on this and don’t have the time or money to get a lawyer for something I trust my parents on.  My parents aren’t trying to screw me out of an inheritance, after all.  

Two years later, In hindsight, I began to wonder if this might cause some kind of liability for me.  To be clear, I want to distribute any assets fairly among all parties.  

If it matters, the whole estate is probably in the range of $750,000 to $1,000,000. 

Am I open to any liability for this?

I've cruised past threads for the past hour in hopes of finding a similar situation, but have had not luck. Earlier today, when driving out of my garage, it fell down onto the hood of my car. The garage features a ""front opening"" design, where I have to pull the handle up and lock it into place at the top. However, there is no locking mechanism. Rather, the door stays in place by balancing on it's hinge at the top. 

I have a few concerns, mainly having to do with liability and insurance. 

* Although I did not hit anything, I did driving the vehicle out of the garage when it fell. *Would this be considered a collision or comprehensive claim?* If I were to hit the garage (for example), that would be a collision claim. If the door fell on my car while parked, that would be a comprehensive claim. However, neither of those apply to my situation. *Would either claim result in an increase of my rate, or an accident on record?*
* I believe this is the fault of the landlord. The garage hinges appear to be covered in rust and do not hold the door up correctly. I took a video after the incident, showing me opening the garage door and it falling down. I have sent it to the landlord. This wasn't much of an issue in the past, so I didn't request for it to be fixed. It has gotten more windy lately, so that may also be a factor in this becoming an issue. *Who is at fault?*

I've laid out a few scenarios. 

1. The landlord would accept fault and pay me for the damages. This wouldn't involve either party's insurance and I can dent repair/ touch up the damage.
2. I go through my insurance and they find me at fault. I pay deductible and my driving record takes a hit + the car looses value due to the damage.
3. My insurance finds the landlord at fault and their property insurance covers my vehicle. I get the dent professionally repaired, painted, and have the PPF replaced on the hood. I also file a claim for lost value and get paid for that.

Which of those are most viable? Is there another scenario that could occur?

Thanks for the help.

Thanks in advance for any light that can be shed on this - I work from home in Florida for a company that's based in Michigan. The position is non-exempt, so generally when I work more than 40 hours a week I get paid 1.5x overtime as you'd expect. However, if there's a holiday or I take PTO on any day of a week, then that doesn't appear to count towards my 40 hours in terms of overtime.

For example, say I take a Monday off and work an extra two hours each other day of the week (so 10 hours each day Tues-Fri). In this case, I get paid for just the normal 40 hours even though there are actually 48 hours on my timecard for the week, which means I basically worked those extra 8 hours for free. If I worked another 2 hours (for a total of 50 hours, 42 worked and 8 PTO) I'd get paid my 40 hours plus 2 hours of overtime.

My actual question is: is that legal? I'm guessing they're skating by on a technicality of what ""hours worked"" means, but I'm not a lawyer and my attempts to sift through labor laws has been frustrating to say the least.",legaladvice,"[FL, MI] Unpaid Overtime",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8l4dm/fl_mi_unpaid_overtime/

4-5 weeks ago we experienced a water/sewage backup in our unit and were without water/toilet for approximately 40 hours before maintenance came out to fix it. Maintenance thought it was due to a blockage somewhere near the exterior drain causing water to back flow into our unit from under fixtures and the wall.

3 weeks ago the front window to the unit above us was broken but tenant was at the property. A few days later the window was still broken and the tenant was not at the property (or not responsive) so I asked my landlords to do a wellness check. When he was not found at the unit police were contacted and he was discovered to be in hospital, but maintenance saw that his unit was destroyed with rotting garbage, overturned furniture, blood, human and animal feces, etc. 

The tenant eventually returned from the hospital still unable to care for himself. The landlords did not fix the window, remove his belongings that had been left occupying 2/3 laundry machines (to service 26 units) and strewn all over the laundry facility. 

Three days ago he turned the water on in his sink and left it on what must have been overnight at least and flooded his entire apartment which caused water to pour into mine through the ceiling, the entire ceiling to soak through even where not visibly wet (my husband is a home inspector and we took thermal images of everything) and certain areas of major concern include above our shower where poking the ceiling made a finger shaped indent a few centimeters deep. Water again flowed from under our fixtures and walls which maintenance again explained in the same manor - which leads me to believe the tenant has likely been flushing garbage which could be the reason for our previous issue.

I immediately cut the water off to his unit and water continued to flow forcefully from under his door for another 2-3 hours (there was that much water in this 500sqft apartment). It took maintenance ~2 hours to get here. He was again taken to the hospital and the interior of his unit was left as it was (but worse because there is an additional weeks worth of festering garbage that has now been under water). Maintenance (vacuumed?) the water and locked up and left. 

We are dealing with moisture, mold, roaches/fleas/ants and the newest, a massive influx of flies so we are assuming there are maggots in the garbage all over the unit, the stench, etc. There is also a cat in the unit.

I expressed my frustration with maintenance that he was allowed back into the unit and no demand was made that he clean/allow them to inspect (truthfully only because they would have seen firsthand that he was incapable of caring for himself). I was told that they don’t have the legal right to enter someone’s property or “tell an adult how to live” (which is bull, they absolutely have a right to tell a tenant they cannot “live” in such a way that is impeding the habitability/quiet enjoyment of other units - I know that, and they know I know that). They insinuated that they had no way of knowing his “lifestyle” could be impacting other residents - I think even the crappiest property management company in business knows that rotting garbage, broken windows and an active pest infestation is or is guaranteed to directly impact neighboring residents if not timely addressed.

We are playing nice and thanking each other in communications because I would like to see how this plays out, but I did demand a timeline of when we can expect the property to be inspected for our safety and, at a minimum, the garbage cleaned up (as I sit here writing this swatting flies away from my face). I was told a representative would be at the property Tuesday midday (but no explanation what they would be doing, if any kind of inspector would attend, remediation team, etc). 

The 7th day after a catastrophic flooding incident seems like a long time when there are actively affected tenants and the structural integrity of the property is in question. They are making it sound like I am going to be taken care of - I am polite, but I’m not stupid. This does not feel right.

Help? If you’ve made it this far, I salute you. (Thanks!)

The father doesn’t want to take care of our baby, but wants the title.

I expressed I’m uncomfortable with him taking the remaining paternity leave time available if he isn’t going to properly care for our child. He said he’ll just have his mother come over. That’s a slap in the face to me and frankly childish on his part. It’s one thing to need help and another to hand off responsibility entirely. He wants to treat paternity leave as a vacation and has actually said as much.

Unable to stand the abuse I left the house in late April of 2017 (we'll say May). I kicked ex out mid-July of 2018 due to child endangerment issues. In that time frame I provided support. Divorce finalized in July of 2019 and support for kids to me started August 2019. I finally got ex to agree to sell the house after ex dragged feet and that was completed in December of 2020. I made all mortgage, tax and insurance payments (through mortgage payment) from August 2018 to December 2020.

Divorce decree states that:

""(I)  shall pay the mortgage (principal and interest), homeowner's insurance, and utility bills as they become due.""

""(I) shall be entitled to take advantage of any benefit which may arise out of the parties ownership during the pendency of this preceding and up to the closing of the sale, including, but not limited to the deduction of mortgage interest, real property taxes, depreciation, repairs and maintenance expenses.""

I am able to produce all paperwork indicating that I followed through with my obligations.

The cost was high for each visit so I ran a check of my insurance and their front office and billing department both stated that my insurance covered my visits for only $20 a visit. I waited until they fully cleared my insurance to receive care. My mother is also a pediatrician and when she came to one of my visits she spoke with the front of office just to make sure it was covered and they were adamant that it was.

After about a couple months of going to visits with my chiropractor, and paying the copay, they switched the front of house person and I was called before my next visit because I was informed that the previous individual that was working the front office had made a mistake with my insurance and instead of my care being covered I actually had no coverage.

Because of that they stated that I owed a $400 difference in what I paid for all previous visits versus what I should have been paying.

It's a bit of a frustrating situation because I would have never sought care from this place of business if I had known that I would have been paying the full cost of treatment and only after going to many visits am I being informed of this mistake and the consequential cost of it. In addition the amount of certainty in which they stated that I had coverage made me trust that I did. 

Am I required to pay this fee since it was a mistake their business made and could I be subject to any legal action if I stated that would not be paying it? It just seems in bad faith but I'm wondering since it was a matter that involves health insurance in the process is different or not.

Worse comes to worst I could pay the fee but in the end I want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing beforehand but if I was the sucker in all this then I'm not to big of a person to admit that.",legaladvice,Mislead about my insurance by my chiropractor,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8kmg8/mislead_about_my_insurance_by_my_chiropractor/

Labor-concerned legal-related general info question - I will not consider any advice posted here actual legal advice, nor should anyone reading it. 

I'm 99% sure flat out denying a request for accommodation then refusing to allow another absence and demanding physical presence to report to an HR SVP with any concerns including ability to physically work is ludicrously illegal, but anyone care to weigh in?

Suppose someone I know were reassigned from their regular job into a completely different job, such as going from a supervisory job at a bank to working in a call center. The reassignment was voluntary and this ""theoretical"" employee was informed via an email ""thanking all the volunteers"" about their involvement in the project. 

Now suppose this employee states to their manager they expect medical concerns and don't want to do it anyway. This request is tossed aside out of hand, point blank no. On day one, ""theoretically"" a Wednesday, the employee has a very severe migraine (documented medical condition the manager is already super aware of) and needs to be out Thursday. 

The manager is texted at 7am stating severe medical issues are developing, and they do NOT think this assignment will work based on existing medical history. The employee continues to be so nice as to voluntarily disclose they've had FMLA at past call center jobs, and have documented medical history with issues in call centers. It is politely and very courteously stated that the employee's contract does not involve call center work, and this is a genuine medical problem.

The employee then SPECIFICALLY REQUESTS AN ACCOMMODATION, DIRECTLY STATES IMMEDIATE MEDICAL INTERVENTION IS NEEDED, AND THAT ANY NECESSARY PAPERWORK IS BEING ACTIVELY REQUESTED TO FILE FOR AN ACCOMMODATION REQUEST FROM HR. 

The response: ""[Name] please report to the [location] phone center tomorrow as this is where the district needs your assistance. If tomorrow you feel sick, [First &amp; Last name (without title) of Regional SVP HR] from Human Resources will be at [location] and is aware of your communication. You may reach out to her there with concerns. We appreciate your support on this important project for our customers and the bank. Thank you.""

Done. At 11:50am the following morning, at work, the employee received an email from a completely different reporting chain of HR stating they had ""been notified of an absence via the reporting system"" and were following up, and IMMEDIATELY asked what accommodations might help, and directly stated that the situation just described shouldn't have happened because it breaks all protocol. They had no knowledge an SVP of HR was already involved. Nothing was ever documented until leave reporting followed up because I called in to that SECOND line to report my absence for a migraine, and was calling to see what they could do to help.

Should I (sorry this person) even have gone into work today or should they immediately be pursuing legal action?

The contract called for a $3500 ""non-refundable"" earnest money deposit. However... We have had multiple issues and I would like to exit the deal with my money if possible. 



To begin, the contract states that the home will be delivered within 5 days of the settlement date or the contract will be voided and earnest money returned. Unfortunately, we are past the 5 days and the home is at least another 30 days away from completion. Additionally, the builder failed a survey inspection for building the home into the city easement and is telling me that I will have to accept the house with the failed inspection because it would cost him too much time/money to request a county variance. Finally, part of the contract was for us to pick custom finishes for the home, which we did do. However, the builder ordered the wrong finishes and is saying it will cost an additional $1700 for him to get the right ones and those costs are now my responsibility. Obviously he's gone mad... To the point that his realtor has told us that he is ""sensitive, emotional, and a hot-head who doesn't always make good decisions""



Our current response has been that he will either meet the contract or return the earnest money or we will be seeking legal action.

One business I was interested in required an NDA before it would be revealed what was actually for sale.

The NDA I signed has verbiage that says I must use them for any transaction related to this business or else I would owe $20000 in damages. But these guys are asking for $50,000 more than the other business listing I found!

I did some of my own research and found that NDAs can't be enforced for knowledge independently obtained from a third party or prior to execution of the document. I have written proof that I already knew of this from a third party before I signed the NDA.

However I'm concerned about the part in the contract that states I'm not allowed to do this transaction on this property without them.

Is this contract enforceable at all? I already emailed them and said I do not consent to any further contact. I'd rather deal with the business directly since they are selling it for so much cheaper.

He threatened to beat me and my dad. Things have been escalating for a while with my 3rd uncle. He lives with my father, mother, older sister, and I. 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house and he lives in the basement. I'm sorry for all the details but they provide necessary context. 

He doesn't pay rent and has never paid rent the four years living here. When my father moved him into the house, he had been living rent-free for a decade with 2nd eldest uncle. They came to physical blows and my dad moved him into our house to pacify the situation. The intent was for him to get a job and help with the mortgage. 

I was upset about him moving into the house at first but then I adjusted to him being here. When I was younger, he would constantly touch me despite me being uncomfortable and upset about it. Not in a sexual way, just in a joking way, so it's okay. He would say, ""Molest! I'm molesting you."" I never liked the jokes about molesting me while touching my stomach but I tolerated it. This continued until high school when I was on sleeping on the couch and he rubbed my belly. I cried out to my mom and she told him to cut it out since I was on my period. That was the final time but I could never quite enjoy being around him. 

I tried to be polite to him and treat him as family. I gave him food occasionally and I greeted him as I entered and left the house. I gave him a computer and monitor so he could continue to play League of Legends since his own computer was so old. He tried to sit down and have a conversation with me once but I was uncomfortable. My mom thankfully came into the dining room and I was able to retreat to my room. 

He was eating a ton of food and increasing my parent's grocery bills to the point of them locking the fridge. They bought a second fridge and placed that in the living room for him to use. He was uninvited to family dinners and asked to buy his own food. He gets free food from food banks and public schools now. When he first moved in, my dad was able to get him a job application at the MTA. Uncle managed to make it into training but was then laid off after a situation with jury duty and properly taking time off. I'm unclear on what transpired that happened to him losing the union job but things became worse at home. 

My mother got him a second job at a Chinese supermarket that he lost once coronavirus started. He then got a job working for the US Census and went on unemployment after that job finished. My dad would ask him to not open the windows during the winter and play on the computer less. The electricity bill was increasing exponentially because he would spend all of his time on the computer when he was at home. 

My parents have gotten into small tiffs with him about him not flushing the toilet. Cleaning the toilets is my chore so it's quite icky to have to deal with daily. He pees in bottles in the living room sometimes even when my sister and I are sitting close by in the dining room. It's gross and his justification is that my dad takes forever in the bathroom downstairs. My sister, mother, and I use the upstairs bathroom. I don't like him coming to the second floor. He does that to get Q-tips from the supply closet. My dad only takes a long time in the downstairs bathroom because he falls asleep on the toilet after working sometimes. He's a bus mechanic and it's physically intensive. He has gone to a physical therapist to deal with the repercussions of his job at the MTA. I will have to take over the mortgage in less than five years and my mother has told me that 3rd Uncle will become my responsibility. 

I was gifted a 7 lb toy poodle by my ex boyfriend. She has a sensitive stomach and is a picky eater. When she eats human food, she doesn't touch her kibble or canned dog food. I asked him to not feed her. When he did it again, I screamed at him to not feed her. I was disrespectful and I shouldn't have lost my temper but I did. My mom reminded me that he has had a hard life, I should respect my elders, and that at least he doesn't beat me like my 1st Uncle used to. 

I'm watching an 11 lb Alaskan Klee Kai for my ex boyfriend this week and it's hard to keep track of both of them. I found out recently my 3rd Uncle has resumed secretly feeding my poodle while I'm watching the Klee Kai. My uncle was chewing on something and I asked him rudely, ""Are you f*ing feeding my dog?"" It's the third time I've had to confront him about feeding my dog and he lost it. 

He told me that I should be more respectful and told me to move away from his corner in the living room. He pushed me away, not in a hard way, just gently but firmly, and said that since I'm 24 I should know better than to talk disrespectfully to people. He then threatened to beat me if I spoke like that to him again. He explicitly said ""I will beat you and your father."" My dad is coming home from work right now so the threat wasn't for him, but for me to know that I can't hide behind my dad? I'm not quite sure why he would throw that tidbit in about my dad. They don't get along but I'm the one that's upset about my dog being secretly fed food. I'm feeling protective about my dad. 

He started stomping on a plastic container, dumped things out of a cardboard box and stomped on that, and squirted salad dressing all over the kitchen. My mother then asked him to leave the house in 3 months if he was going to throw another tantrum. 

So my question is, when the eviction moratorium ends, what do I do to start the process? Is there a way to evict him and allow him to keep his dignity? We're Chinese so pride is important. I'd like to avoid hurting more of his feelings. My mother doesn't want the neighborhood finding out about this problem. Maybe we could have the lawyer send a gently worded letter inviting him to move out and live elsewhere without an eviction on his legal record. Would talking to a lawyer affect his criminal record? 

He is an army veteran so he may or may not have guns. I was told not to go near his things when he was younger because of the guns but I'm not sure if he still has them. I've overheard him talking to his best friend Will about ""ending it once and for all."" I'm beginning to get a little paranoid but this is the first time he's threatened to beat me. And he knows my 1st Uncle used to beat me so it could just be an empty threat used to hurt me. 

Should I call the police and tell them what just happened? That would leave a legal record. I didn't record the conversation with the threats so I don't have proof. I'm just a little confused on what to do. I would like to treat him gently and with kindness but also not have him in my life anymore. I would send him money monthly in order to help him out so I'm not abandoning him. I am unable to have a proper conversation with him to communicate this.

While with another section of the wall and the other neighbor, they have placed a drainage pipe to drain water into our property which is also eroding the dirt in that section, and is, as far as we’re aware, a safety violation. 

We are planning on building a permitted retaining wall along the property line. I’ve read that California law says the cost of the fence is supposed to be shared by both neighbors. They will not voluntarily split the cost of the retaining wall, my question is are they obligated to, especially considering the current fence and drainage pipe are not up to code, and if so, will I need to lawyer up to get them to pay if they refuse?",legaladvice,Shared Fence in Los Angeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8jw5c/shared_fence_in_los_angeles/

Contract was signed 3/11/2021. The purchase was for 29,000 for a 200 sq ft home. 

I was in Las Vegas but the house/business is in Phoenix, AZ. 

The contract called for 4 payments: deposit, 25% complete, 50% and final. I have paid 3/4 ($21,750). The last payment was on April 24th. 

After that, everything started falling apart. The regular updates became fewer or nonexistent for long stretches. Lies upon lies. 

I visited in June when I realized that what he is building is not what was represented by the plans, contract or discussion. He had promised to be done 7/3. 

Then my lease ended Aug 1st and I went to an Airbnb in Arizona to check on the house. Still so very far from being completed. 

Last Saturday, 7 days ago, I went with a good attitude and trying to be positive. I asked about the delivery fee. He said it’s not included. I said that isn’t what I thought or the lawyer I had review it thought and he blew a gasket! 

His face got red. He started screaming at me about threatening him and said he would rather “set the house on fire and shoot himself in the head” then give me anything and to get the “f” off his property.

My husband and I live in an apartment complex in Alabama. And overall, the place has been great; it's a nice unit, and the property managers have been great. The problem is our neighbors in the unit below us. 

They have absolutely no concept of volume control. They have fights almost daily (several times a week at least). I am still on a quasi work-from-home schedule. I'm a postdoc, so a lot of times I can do data analysis and write from home. There are many days when I cannot escape the yelling, so I resort to either maxing out my headphones or use ear plugs. I even bought a white-noise generator. They also have a small terrier which was barking 24/7 for a while. On top of that, they just had a baby, which cries constantly (nothing can be done about that, babies cry, I get it). After several months of dealing with the noise, I spoke to the property manager, specifically about the dog. I have a background in animal behavior, and it sounds like the dog is stressed out from being left alone or crated most of the day. However, the fact is the barking fills our entire apartment, and it's like nails scraping down a chalkboard. The manager said they would speak with the couple. 

A day or two after speaking with the main office, I had just finished bringing in groceries. Almost immediately, someone started banging on the front door, like REALLY pounding aggressively. I had a feeling that it was the downstairs neighbor, but I felt very uncomfortable answering. I was home alone, and when I looked out of the peephole, I did not see anyone. I ignored it. As a side note, this was during May - June 2021, and I was doing a lot of field work at the time. I was driving to Tennessee, Arkansas, Florida, and Mississippi on weekends. I had just gotten back from Arkansas, a drive from hell since I experienced the 1-40 bridge closure in real time. But I digress, I was getting into my car the next day, and the downstairs neighbors were bringing in groceries. The wife immediately got right up in my space yelling about me complaining to the main office about her dog. I was still very tired after an 11 hr drive, so I just stood there while she was yelling about how she ""has a right to have a dog; she pays the dog's rent; I'm a liar; we don't fight; you have a problem you talk to me; my dog doesn't bark ever"". I basically said look, your dog was barking a lot, I took audio recordings to the main office, please try to keep it from barking hours on end. She just huffed off. 

That interaction left me a little rattled, so I  went back to the main office and told them what happened. They apologized and said they did not give the neighbors our names. Evidently, the wife canvassed the entire building asking residents if they complained about the dog - process of elimination I suppose. The manager also revealed they had been struggling with the new baby and she had lost her job, and I get it, it's a rough time for everyone right now. But I should be able to work without being interrupted by screaming and barking dogs on on a regular basis. The manager said this tenant has never been difficult - she ""didn't think she would get violent"". Then again, a woman was murdered in our building last year (unrelated to our neighbor). As the upstairs neighbor, I try to walk in socks or slippers, minimize noise, I rarely have the TV volume over 4. But I was accused of stomping around on purpose (plot twist: I have misophonia from childhood PTSD, so no, would never do that). 

This brings me to the other issue: they are regular pot smokers, I can smell it weekly. And I have no issue with marijuana use; I'm all for it being legalized. That being said, the smell seeps into our apartment via the bathroom ducts. I can't have my windows open most nights since they smoke it on their patio. This has been a problem since we moved in. I have not complained about the pot smoking since I did not want to risk an overzealous police response. 

Tonight was my breaking point. It's been a rough few weeks for me personally - manuscript deadlines, teaching plans, research proposal deadlines; I'm running on fumes. Since Wednesday, it's like we've been living above the set of Jerry Springer. I can't tell if it's a party or a fight. Tonight, Friday, they decided to have a party on the patio; the pot smell was already coming into the bathroom. I opened the front door to grab a package and the heavy skunk smell hit me like truck. Smoke from cigarettes and marijuana is a migraine trigger for me, so I took an excedrin as a preemptive measure. They were being extremely loud on the front lawn of the building. I just wanted some quiet. So I called the nonemergency police number and reported them, including the pot smell. It's quiet now, but I am a little concerned the next time we run into them.

I have a few audio recordings of the fights heard from our apartment. Part of me feels like an asshole for calling the cops, but I'm not sure what to do at this point. My husband tried knocking on their door to talk to them back when the wife confronted me about the dog complaint, but they refused to speak. Should I bring up the pot smoking with the property manager? Maybe they'll be more cognizant of their noise/pot smoking after the cop call. I'm just worn out from their squabbles, and I'm not familiar with possible resolutions from a legal perspective.",legaladvice,Difficult neighbors - need advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8job8/difficult_neighbors_need_advice/

I thought the coaching was for 3 months and my initial payment was the ONLY payment. The personal trainer stated that he told me over the phone this was a 6-month contract, but I cannot remember this.

I told the personal trainer I would not sign the contract and immediately cancelled the coaching. I stated I wanted a refund, or I'll take the situation to the small claims court. Initially, the personal trainer declined to refund me at all. After messaging back and forth, they then offered a 50% refund instead.

I started having vomiting episodes at around 16/17 (2015ish), and after a of multiple tested and visits to the same GI was diagnosed with a condition called Gastroparesis. I didn't fully believe I had Gastroparesis as some of my symptoms didn't line up. I brought up a condition called CVS to my doctor a few times and every time it went ignored. 

My GI doctor then prescribed me Reglan 10mg 4x a day, I was not explained how bad the side effects from this medication are, nor that it should only be used for 12 weeks. 

After about 2/3 years of seeing this GI, she continued my course of Reglan, and eventually she informed me that because she was a pediatric doctor, she could no longer see me after I turned 21. I was still 20 when she refused to see me again. 

In 2019, I experienced a severe episode of Lockjaw, which sent me to the hospital. I was sent home with Xanax and Reglan.

Through 2017 to early 2021 I went to multiple ER's and doctors, I never received further testing and was continued to be prescribed Reglan. 

I recently have seen a new GI who told me to quit Reglan immediately, and since then, I have had severe problems with my jaw clinching, and tics/tremors in my face.

My new GI ordered a new Gastric Emptying Scan which proved that I never had Gastroparesis. 

I'm worried about my long term neurological health as I feel the medication may have already done some damage.

I’m curious if the answer is the same. Details below vague on purpose, but I can fill in if necessary. 

Summer 2019 I moved to USA (Virginia) from an international country on a student visa. Fall 2019 I received a financial aid check (that I did not apply for) in an amount of more than $1,000 but less than $10,000.

Because I did not apply for this, I went to the Dean’s office where they told me this was likely a scholarship, but to check with the financial aid office. 

The financial aid office told me, after looking up my account—although not in writing—that this was a scholarship, included as part of my program, and, in effect, “congratulations!”

It all seemed a little weird to me at the time, but not knowing the system (and being told that everything was all good by people who supposedly do), I assumed what they said was accurate. 

I’m sure everyone can guess what happened next. I received a letter this week stating that this money was given to me “in error” two years ago, and asking me to return the money. Moreover, they asked me to return an amount more than $1,000 ABOVE what was issued (the difference pre-tax vs. after tax, I assume). I’m supposed to meet with them on Tuesday. 

My questions are basically twofold:

1. Is there a statute of limitations on this (or whatever the correct legal term would be), that would make the amount of time passing a factor? 

My guess is that, similar to the banking mistake scenario, an error is an error and I would owe regardless of when they realized it. Although it being university financial aid and my complete lack of understanding of the system muddies the water a little bit. The only reason why I believe it actually was an error and not them just trying to fix their budget after Covid is because I didn’t ever apply for it. 

2. Can they actually charge me for the pre-tax amount, or do I have grounds to only pay back what actually made it’s way into my account?

Looking back, even now I’m not sure what other steps I should have taken to ensure that this money was actually mine.

I was hoping to get some legal advice as to what my next options should be following a pretty violent crime that I went through this week.

16 August I had stopped after work at a vape shop about 2 miles from work. I got there and the shop was closed, so I walked back to my car and plugged my phone in, getting ready to head home. A few seconds later the passenger side curtain airbags deployed, along with my steering wheel air bag. Shortly thereafter my drivers door was opened, and the person that hit my car started attacking me with a crowbar. After a few blows to the upper chest/head area, I somehow got away from him and the car, trying to make an escape in any direction possible. He eventually caught up to me and knocked me to the ground, starting to hit me over and over with a crowbar. I managed to grab the weapon once or twice and knock him off balance enough to sprint away and luckily find a sheriff deputy that was able to apprehend him. An ambulance was called and I was rushed to the nearest hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

Upon reception at the hospital, an exam and subsequent CT scan were performed where it was discovered that I had around 7-8 lacerations/puncture wounds, in addition to a broken jaw, broken sinus cavity, and a fractured skull. I was admitted to the ICU and had a craniotomy performed to remove broken pieces of skull from my brain. I've made a fairly nice recovery, and understand there are programs for me that will cover the hospital bills that I incurred from the attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is pretty straight forward: what legal options do I have to pursue additional damages or compensation from either the perpetrator or the state, and are they worth pursuing? This has been a fairly traumatizing experience as you can imagine, but am having a difficult time narrowing down my options in my state as a lot of what I've found has been fairly vague. Is it worth consulting with a lawyer for additional compensation or should I just be happy I'm not dead and move on?

In case you cause problems, he will have the JOD/Custody order with him should the authorities arrive.   
Fast forward a month, to today. School starts next week.

2. The attorney's claim made no reference to the custody order stating that if vacation time went after school, BOTH parties had to agree to it. My husband did not agree.   
3. We tried to work this out with opposing counsel at least 3 times over the course of several months and she just ignored our messages. Now today she's saying her client can take the child because she followed procedure, like literally everyone has to do, and notified the court of her vacation time.

Across all 3 units, we are all University/college students attending a nearby university and most of us are international students. Because finding housing was complicated with me and my roommates all being international students, we sort of went with what the landlord said and fast forward, we have now been living here for a week (we are here for a 1 year lease). We also had a zoom call with the previous tenant who was also a student and she said the place had no problems and that the landlord was really chill. 

Now in the backyard (which is basically the front yard as the entrance to our unit (floor 2) and unit 3 (floor 3) are through the backyard) there is a roughly 8 by 25 feet shed/wooden building. There are 2 doors to the shed, the first opens up and their is a dryer and washer (which we all use) and the other door is to enter the shed. The landlord never told us not to go into the shed but we never had a need too so we have not yet. One of my roommates mistook the two doors and cracked the second door open to see the landlord lying down in a bed with a blanket on, which promptly made the landlord tell him to close it and he left (the entire interaction was less than 5 seconds). Looking back, it was weird to me how the landlord was able to show up so quick (&lt; 1minute) and she would just say she was in the neighbourhood. 

  
In all honesty, I don't mind it that much because likely if my roommate did not have that interaction, I would have spent the year with thinking that the shed was just storage. But the more I think about it, it irks me a tiny bit. Firstly, I am almost certain that she is connecting to the Wi-Fi the utilities that we pay her for. Secondly, I wish she let us know or that it was in the lease. In the photos for the place, she took the photo of the backyard with the shed behind her so since the rest of the backyard was empty, we assumed the entire backyard was empty. I definitely wanted to host small dinner between friends or all the 3 units in the backyard but now knowing that she is in the shed makes it weird.

We have discussed it and would both like to be able to start seeing other people while separated before the divorce in finalized. (Not necessarily that we will, but want to keep the option open.) What is the best way to document this in a legally-enforceable way in case someone changes their mind partway through the process? Is that not even a issue, something that can simply be stated in the separation agreement, or is there a separate filing that can be done with the court to create a legal agreement specifically dealing with this question?

I was told by the property manager before I moved in (May 19th this year) that there would be some construction for a few months as they're replacing the buildin's siding, entry doors, and windows of the entire complex.

I recently signed a 2br/2ba lease with a roommate for a furnished top floor apartment in Texas. The lease is by the bedroom and the start date and move-in date was August 15th. I decided I would pick up my keys and move in at a later date (Aug 22nd), which the apartment complex was perfectly OK with as I had already paid my rent for August and sent in all my documents. My roommate, on the other hand, moved in on August 15th. That night, it rained and she realized the ceiling in my bedroom was leaking water. She called emergency maintenance and they came and put a bucket under the leak and left. The next morning, they drilled holes in the ceiling to air out the moisture. My roommate alerted me to the situation and I put in a maintenance request in writing. After a bunch of back and forth with my roommate and I calling the apartment office and getting zero helpful information on what they were planning on doing about the ceiling leak, the manager finally called me and said that they'll be getting roofers out soon since it's an issue with the roof (I figured, since the apartment is on the top floor) and gave me a bunch of hogwash that essentially translated to ""we're working on it"".

A few days later, it rains, and the ceiling leaks again (of course).

My roommate and I have been calling pretty much every day for an update, and so far, they haven't had an update for me. Imo I would be less angry if this happened 6 months down the road, but the lease JUST started, the ceiling leaked the day I was supposed to move-in (and leaked again a couple days later), and it still hasn't been fixed? I've also already paid full August rent (by their policies) which I would have been perfectly fine with despite choosing to move it at a later date had it been livable and habitable, but it rains every 3 days here. I just personally find it completely ridiculous that they gave me a unit/bedroom with a ceiling leak. They're also closed on the weekend, so I know it's not getting fixed this weekend either. I need to move-in on the 22nd because I need to be in the city by the 23rd, so I have no choice but to move-in (and I have a binding yearlong lease anyway...), but is there ANYTHING I could do to force them to get their ish together? It's a by-the-bedroom lease, so my lease is for this bedroom + the shared common area... If the ceiling is leaking in my bedroom, what am I paying so much money for? If not, is there any legal workaround to getting out of the lease, or at least getting them to discount my rent or putting me in a hotel until the bedroom leak is fixed?

Thank you all so much for the help in advance!

I feel like this a) sends a message, b) doesn't cause anyone physical harm, and c) gets them out of my space quickly without having my baby's feed interrupted. 

However, a few people I have mentioned this plan to have said that this could be considered assault. I can't imagine anyone seriously considering getting spritzed with water assault, but I know sometimes assault is very loosely defined. Could I get in legal trouble for spraying people with water? If they were harassing me, does that change the situation legally at all?

I am renting out a room in a townhouse. The other 2 rooms are occupied with other tenants. 1 room is “empty” until someone moves in.

1. Landlord has been staying in that room (without telling any of us before we moved in) a few days out of the week for months now. 

2. Landlord wants us to split bills amongst each other but not charge her. Even though she has been using the utilities. 

3. Landlord touches all of our belongings and moves them around whenever she likes. At least a few times a week.

4. Landlord bans us from using AC and eating in the kitchen. We have to eat in our rooms. Her reason is that it will get too dirty.

5. Landlord doesn’t allow us to store our extra belongings in the garage without charging us a monthly rent. (Was not listed in the lease)

6. Landlord follows us around and harasses us in the house if we do not listen to what she says (such as putting dishes away)

7. Landlord micro manages all of us by allowing each person to only have 2 cabinets in the kitchen or 2 spots in the fridge/freezer. If your items are not in your correct spot then she moves it and stuffs all your groceries into your “assigned” area.

8. Landlord put a couch in the dining room and moved our table out so nobody can eat together. She verbally told us that only one person can eat at the same time.

9. Landlord is renting out the garage to other people that don’t live in the townhouse as storage unit. So there is usually random stuff that take up the whole garage.

10.Landlord only allows one portion of the stove to be used. The other portions are covered so they stay clean. 

When everyone first moved in, she started making up this rules that were never stated in the lease. She now wants to charge us for leaving marks in her sink because we leave our plates in there.

A while ago her sister moved in with us, not long after I notified both of them that my boyfriend and I are getting our own place, we are moving the 22nd. Since then she has not communicated with me aside from telling me the amounts due for bills. Yesterday I get an email from our property manager telling us that our lease was approved to be extended a couple weeks into September. She then finally texts me and says she requested the extention (obviously) because their place won't be ready until then. However I did not agree to the extention, and I refuse to lose any of my part of the security deposit for any damage/mess her and her sister leave behind once I move out THIS WEEKEND. 

This is the kicker, our property manager that sent me the email of approval IS IGNORING ME. I have sent two emails this week, one before I knew about the extention and one after, I've also tried calling her. I called her just now, it rang once and then voicemail (so she's declining calls from a tenant) and then she sent me an email saying all deposits stay until the lease ends, the keys are returned, and inspection completed. All normal shit, except now the inspection is taking place almost a month after I'm moving out and two other people (who are being petty af) still residing in the residence. I wouldn't care if my money wasn't on the line, or if I could trust my roommate, but with how she's been acting I don't feel I can trust her.

They bought a model home. It was only meant to be a representative of one of the look/outside of the developer's homes. The inside was unfinished:

-No flooring/subfloor only

-No walls...drywall or frames only

-No doors on any of the rooms

-No electricity inside except for one room

-No plumbing

-No HVAC system

-No property stairs

Etc.

For reasons I don't understand to this day my parents lived in it as and renovated it. The only thing they did was put in a toilet and sink in the bathroom and run extention cords from the kitchen which had the electric done.

About 9-10 years ago they bought the house next door. Exact same conditions as theirs. The other outside model home for the developer. My brother lives there now. My parents always supported him. My parents said we would each inherit one house. I figured I'd just sell and be done with it.

My dad died last year. In the course of helping my mom sort everything out I found out that they had estimates done on both houses about fixing them up and for both the price was substantially more than what the house is worth. I got new estimates since the ones I found were over 8 years old. All 4 said that's still true, the cost is more than they are worth. Even to tear down and sell the lot isn't profitable and would be a loss because the lots don't have yard space, they were never meant to. I also consulted firms that buy as is but they said no as well. Real estate agents said the same as the estimators. That would be true they were clear of mortgages but on top of everything both houses are underwater on the mortgages too. My mom lied when she said they were owned outright. I didn't find that out until after I got the estimates and talked to the realtors.

The work that needs doing isn't surface stuff like painting that I could do myself. Now that I know this I don't want to inherit the house.

I purchased a Boss laser engraver in March of 2018, financed with CIT Bank.  Myself, my mom, and my business (LLC I own 100%) signed the contract with CIT Bank.    


The Boss laser arrived and was not properly strapped down in the crate, letting the machine to bounce around for over 1,500 miles.  Needless to say the machine was in bad shape.    


A decision was made to send the Boss laser back, at which time Boss Laser refunded the full amount back to CIT Bank.    


During this time.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I had already been talking to a different laser machine company about one of their machines and the decision was made to go with a Trotec Laser Engraver.     


CIT was not helpful regarding this matter, basically refusing a refund of my deposits and payments on the Boss Laser loan, further pushing the need for a decision to made soon and after the Boss laser incident they were off the table.   Reluctantly the Trotec laser was financed through them.    


(This moment here is the one I wish I would have paused at, CIT Bank was showing horrible service and continuing to do business with them let a lone finance double the amount was foolish, a decision made under emotional duress. )   


An addendum to the original agreement was signed by myself as President of the LLC only.  Mom did not sign any further documents on this matter, nor did myself personally.    


CIT was provided a Purchase order and quote from Trotec for the new machine.  The problems begin.    
In the agreement CIT was to hold final payment for the laser to Trotec til the laser was ready to ship.   They did not, they paid Trotec without any approval from myself or mom months before the machine shipped.  Obligating the start of loan payments for a piece of equipment that had not even shipped.  


Several months go by and the Trotec laser finally arrives with an invoice from Trotec, which is a 1,000 over the quote/ Purchase order that was provided to CIT Bank.  I've now been making payments for several months on a laser that was not in my possession and for an amount I did not agree too.     


Begin disputing again with CIT regarding this, no luck so in 2019 I fall behind on payments and the accounts goes into collections.  Again still no contact at all from CIT to mom on any of these matters.   She is not a member of the LLC, her credit is much better than mine and lower the monthly payment was why she was even involved at all with the original boss laser.   


An agreement with myself and CIT bank forced and payments began, but I could never get a clear answer from CIT regarding the balance or the penalty for missed payments.  Just threats regarding this matter.    


My health begins to get worse, and Q4 of 2019 I have major surgery which took months to recover from, still managed to continue payments all through 2020.  However CIT Bank began to miss agreed upon dates for payment withdrawal, started just a few days, then week and by December it was moving into the next month for the last month's payment.  Payments were to be pulled on the 15th of the month or the following Monday if the 15th fell on a weekend per the agreement.   


In December 2020, my patience was gone with them and I wanted a number to pay off the loan so I could move it else where.   At which time I was informed of the additional 6,000 interest they had added to the loan.  Further research at that time, showed not only did CIT not have a BBB rating, but had numerous complaints brought up against them.     


The decision was made to let the loan go to collections.  


Well they filed a lawsuit against mom, myself and the business and that brings us today. 

The thought was that mom should be removed from the lawsuit because she never signed for the new laser and that would leave myself and the LLC Business liable.  Which given all the health problems I currently have plus Covid, filing bankruptcy was an option.   


We have hired a lawyer to discuss the matter with, and he thought offering them a settlement offer of 2,000 might be an option to get the matter to go away.    


Well the 2,000 was offered and declined, with a response that CIT wants to settle, yeah right.  So 3,000 was offered declined, they came back that we owe 23,000 ( 14,000 principal, 5,600 interest and 3,000 plus for attorney's fees ) Mind you the 14,000 principal is the remaining balance on loan including 25% interest and the 1,000 they over paid for the Trotec laser.  So they want 25% interest from the original loan plus interest on that interest and attorney's fee.  


An offer of 7,500 was made, the remaining principal on the loan plus some and it too was declined.  Our final offer of 10,000 was made and again they rejected it as well.  They currently are demanding 17,000 or we move forward in the lawsuit.  CIT's lawyer is claiming this will be handled by summary judgement and that the judge will award their full amount of over 23,000 plus.   That a trial will not be allowed, and that the judge will side with them.   


Furthermore, they are claiming that mom will be responsible as well.     


Mom is the problem here, she cannot file bankruptcy nor do I want her too at all...   She never signed the Trotec paperwork which tripled the monthly payment without her authorization.  Complete mess I dragged her into, from the beginning with the Boss Laser all to save a few bucks, really wish I had not done it all.    


 I am fine filing bankruptcy but we don't think that will remove her from the liability.   Which is the problem.    


Really could use some help here, I am based in AZ and CIT is based in New Hampshire with the paperwork stating New Hampshire law applies.   Their lawyer is based in Arizona with me however and the lawsuit has been filed in Arizona.   


We want to make a final offer, but really need some leverage before we do.  We are trying to be reasonable here, original loan was for 24,720 with 18,000 principal, which includes the 1,000 they paid without authorization or paper work.  I have paid 12,000 plus already, leaving about 12,500 remaining from the original loan including the 1,000 over payment and 6,720 interest.  Which is why I thought 10,000 was fair, but 17,000 is far from fair and 23,000 is insane.  Plus they want the money now, which getting 10,000 was the most I could get access too.    


\-  Does anyone know of any laws regarding co signers of loans and required signatures ?    


\-  or Cases regarding Banks being in violation of contract.  They have so many items in the original contract that they violated.    


Our lawyer was discussing filing a Motion to Dismiss to remove mom, but now he is  leaning towards filing a Summary Judgement, which as you can imagine is more money.  However he is not sure if the judge would dismiss mom from the lawsuit, so it is a gamble... Which is the concern, spending thousands on lawyer fees with her still being liable.  Plus regardless what happens on her side, I'm still liable so it will be a few thousand to file bankruptcy on my side.  Which will be less than 10,000, so it is a cheaper option, however a really shitty one.    


Thought if I could get mom off of this, then I would have leverage for them to settle, cause my deteriorating health plus covid has left me pennyless.   Really don't want to lose the laser, cause it is my only way to make money when health allows.  However mom's credit and retirement matters more, while we discuss options.     


Thanks for any help with cases, laws or any other leverage we might have.  If you have any other thoughts on where we should look, please let me know.

First-time poster. I have a whirlwind of a tale, so I'll try and keep it as concise and to the facts as possible. My intent is to receive a suggestion as to further actions that might be taken, and the specific type of legal counsel that we might look to retain (elder fraud, elder abuse, etc.).

In the Fall of 2016, my wife's grandmother who lives in Florida, was the subject of a (favorable) national news story through the actions of an employee belonging to a nationally-known and recognized business. In the articles written about her regarding the circumstance through which she was being included, it was brought to light that she was both elderly and living alone, without the direct aid of family assistance. A repugnant individual decided to take advantage of this information and telephoned her to say that she had further been the winner of a sweepstakes contest, which was also being promoted by the aforementioned business (untrue). She was then hoodwinked into pre-paying taxes on her supposed winnings, to multiple individuals, in the tune of some $300k over the course of two years (her life savings). These individuals she was paying were portraying themselves as agents of the Social Security Administration, IRS and Federal Reserve. 

It should be noted that during this time her grandmother had been undergoing chemotherapy and was incredibly vulnerable/susceptible to being coerced into such actions. Furthermore, the bank she was using to wire transfer these funds had continued to aid in doing so, even after talking to her about the potential for a scam, and a police report had been filed with the Sheriff’s department. About half of the total funds transferred occurred AFTER the police report had been formally filed. We contacted the bank and asked why a family member, whom was also on the account as a ""Pay On Death"" beneficiary, had not contacted. The bank suggested that he, the beneficiary, had been attempted to be reached on multiple occasions.  When questioned, the family member said that he had not been contacted even a single time by the bank to discuss the issue.

My wife only recently become power of attorney, and is just beginning to uncover the misgivings that have taken place. The individuals involved, consisting of a network of possibly up to thirty different persons in the scam, have yet to be formally charged. My wife's grandmother has also kept a ludicrous amount of paperwork pertaining to each account number that was transferred into, along with names (perhaps aliases) and addresses that were used in this scam.  After amounts had been drained from each account, it was then closed. We are now trying to access these accounts to try and perform our own forensic accounting to try and resolve the dates of each transaction, and match it to the notes her grandmother kept. At this time I don't want to say that the bank is stonewalling our requests, however they have yet to fulfill it. While we are unable to have complete transparency on the closed accounts, we are still able to piece much of it together through the grandmother's documentation (retained bank statements).

**NOTES:**  
\+One of the cashier checks that was made out during this ordeal was for $130k, and had actually been rejected, however the funds have yet to be returned to the account as far as we can see. The bank will not acknowledge what has happened to this money.

\+The Florida Bar Association has been contacted, and several lawyers have been provided by them by name, however again, we have yet to secure legal counsel as our case doesn’t seem to be an exact fit for anyone recommended.

\+The police did not follow-up on the issue. The bank did not discontinue fund transfers after suspicion of fraud. The individuals have yet to be charged.

\+My wife has filed a report with the FTC, which was suggested by the FBI.

Any advice as to how to retain legal counsel for the specific areas that this case might pertain to would be of great help.

Greetings to the peeps here on r legaladvice,  and thank you so much for reading my question. 

I am writing inquire about the basics of tort regarding whether a roommate is liable for preventing you from accessing a utility included or from preventing you from installing your own utility if a lease contract allows for it.

I also wish to find how liabilty differs between a resource owned by a lease ( by contract) , and a resource monopolized by a contenant who them prevents others from using it or their own wevices.

My situation is in that I was being threatened last year with violence and eviction over trying to install a service for internet, that I wished to use

His goal was to coerce [key word] me onto using his service and then make me pay him, even

I would incur losses doing so, first becaysebitvwould cut into income saved for school/work, and second becaysebitvwould because I would not have any guarantee that he would actually honor his oral contract and if he turned it off to cooerce more money, he would trlthreaten me with eviction again.

I need to stay at the house because moving back in with my family would cost me too much.

What should I do to remedy this and what torts are needed to nail this dude in court?

The air conditioning company informed us that it is likely we may have mold growth throughout the house wherever the air conditioning vents are located. I have submitted inquiries to various mold remediation companies and am pending a response for a cost to repair. 

We had our home inspection completed in June. The inspection made no reference to the mold growth, however it can be clearly seen on the inspection report photograph of the garage.

That night I called out for the next day and texted my manager I was injured at work. 

A week after this I had to call out again because the pain was so bad, the following week I was able to see my Dr. And she said I was indeed injured and told me to take a little over a week off of work. I gave my Dr's note to my supervisor and informed her I wouldn't be able to come in for over a week. I then ask her if I need to fillout any paper work regarding my injury and and says no.

Four days into my medical leave I ask my supervisor if she filed my injury with the workplace insurance, or to the PA department of labor, or had done any sort of paperwork to log my injury. She replies ""no, I didn't know you got hurt at work"" which is bullshit because in the same text chain to her, my first text to her states I was injured at work. 

Two days after asking for paperwork, she still has yet to file anything from my injury nor has given me any information or paperwork on how to start a workmans comp claim. She texted me claiming ""I can't get to it because we're shorthanded and busy"". My place of work is severely understaffed at the moment so even when I'm in were still 5 people short of the 8 people that should be employed in my dept. So my supervisor is claiming to be too busy to get me any information or paperwork. 

I contacted a local workmans comp attorney and said he was busy all day today but will call be back early Monday morning. 

I just don't know what else to do. So any help or suggestions would help me a lot. 

So to summarize:

- injured at work 
-day after injury I told supervisor
-went to my Dr, yup I'm injured, on medical leave now
-given no paperwork or info on what to do, I finally demanded workmans comp paperwork 
- two work days straight supervisor claims she's too busy to help me

For most of the main COVID lockdown I didn't really give it much thought, but earlier this year when things were opening up I started the process to renew my license.

Maryland recently swapped to RealID's which requires proof of citizenship. I'm a child of two military parents birth abroad and could not find the form we use in lieu of a birth certificate so I had to request a new one from the State Department which was heavily delayed due to COVID. 

Two months ago I got pulled over driving home from a friends house and was going to get a warning for speeding, but when the officer saw my expired license he wrote me up for driving without a license even though I told him of the extension per the governor. He said it applied only to permits and that I should just show up with my new license and be good. I have since renewed my license and the MVA confirmed that the extension was still in place.

I'm just wondering if there is anything I can do to alleviate this before my court date which is November of this year. I have a vacation planned on the date in question and I have security clearances that I don't want impacted by this so I want it to go as smooth as possible.

I've never had to attend a court case so I'm a bit out of depth with this whole thing and looking for any advice at all.

Last year I started my freshman year of college. Near the beginning of the first semester I broke the small bone in my lower leg which led to me having leg surgery. Because of my lack of mobility at that point I decided to switch to all online classes for the time being. In addition, I had to move back home to my family of 8. This was a very difficult transition. The school was not very cooperative or helpful in giving me access to classes online (which is very ironic considering we are literally in a pandemic). 

The unproductive environment I was living in along with being in and out of the hospital for complications and being on painkillers I ended up doing terribly in my classes. I thought I could just make it up the next semester. Wrong.
&amp;nbsp;
Near the end of my first semester, I discovered painful bump sitting on my spine near my lower back. This ended up being a cyst that had caused an infection. This led to even more hospital visits than before, more painkillers, regularly having high grade fevers, some of the worst pain I've ever felt and another surgery. 
&amp;nbsp;
But the fun didn't stop there. I could not bend or sit for 3 months or so, however I still have back pain and trouble bending to this day. Because of these limitations I had to continue going to class online. My school was still not very helpful during this time. In addition to all of these physical health problems, I was being mis-medicated for an undiagnosed Bipolar disorder (I discovered this in May of this year)
&amp;nbsp;
I received the highest scholarship my college offered and a Pell Grant (and more), and even then my family had difficult paying for the few hundred dollars left (and could not afford books). I appealed for my scholarship over the summer which was (thankfully) approved. I then appealed with financial aid hoping to get my Pell Grant back. Today they emailed me denying me ANY financial aid. I had written a 3 page appeal letter and included documentation and letters from my surgeries, physical therapy, the hospital and my psychiatrist.

Today (Friday 20th August), we were informed that we needed to attend work for 8pm. We were not informed of manager P's PCR result and whether it came back positive.
A member of staff (A) who has symptoms informed management that they did a lateral flow test today, which returned positive. He was told to come into work regardless and to book a PCR test. He refused on the grounds that he had symptoms and didn't want to bring it into work. On a speakerphone call in front of the other members of staff present, manager S (Manager P's higher up) then informed us that A would be sacked, one member of staff said, ""but he's had a positive lateral flow test"" 
To which Manager S replied ""it's okay, we'll get him on something else""
A is currently still unaware that he is going to be fired.

&gt; Earned vacation pay, commissions, and bonuses cannot be forfeited unless the employer has a written forfeiture clause in its vacation, commission, or bonus policy or termination policy pursuant to N.C.G.S. 95-25.13(2) of the WHA. Keep in mind that vacation pay, commissions, or bonuses have to be earned, regardless if a verbal promise or a written policy, before an employer has to pay them at all. Also, even if there is a written policy that has a written forfeiture clause, an employee may still be due the earned vacation pay, commissions, or bonuses at termination. It all depends on the language of the forfeiture clause and the reason/s the employee's employment was discontinued, and if the reason/s meet the criteria in the written forfeiture clause. 

The only language in the employee handbook and anything I've seen about this issue is here, nothing about this was specified in any offer letter, or document I've seen before:

She lives with her mother and the two of them recently bought a house together. (There's more legal/financial stuff regarding that but this post isn't actually about this house.) To my understanding, both of their names are on the house's deed.

Recently, my friend's grandmother passed and she inherited a condo. Now her mother is suggesting to put both of their names on that condo's deed again. She cited some nonspecific (at least not specified to me) protective legal measures as the reason.

Here's where the problem comes in: My friend is currently coming to grips with the fact that her mother is emotionally abusive and controlling. We are not talking the worst of the worst, but I've definitely encouraged her to move out and get some space between them.

This is exactly why I want to know the perks of a shared deed and what risks she would run if the deed is only in her name. Additionally, I wonder what her mother would be enabled to do if she did end up on the deed. I want any advice I give to my friend to be well informed on these things.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT based on info I figured might be relevant after reading the first replies: The mom has not asked about any kind of financial split, and I do not think she's after making profits off this. I can't be sure, of course. The condo also currently has tenants, so any plans of my friend moving in are hypothetical for now.

EDIT 2: I've been sent the exact points my friend's mom brought up, namely: If something happens to either of them, there's no mess with transferring ownership and if either of them got sued (for whatever reason), the property couldn't be touched since neither of them would own it individually.

My two youngest sisters (15 and 16) live at home with my mother and her husband. The situation at their home is not ideal: my mother's husband has severe anger issues and is home 24/7 because he does not work. The latest demonstration of his anger is when my  sister (24) shared a post about childhood trauma, which my mother took personally. The husband replied on her post, saying some awful things about my sister,  including saying she's just like my dad (alcoholic, lost custody, reported for possible molestation of youngest sister). My sister's (24) fiancee responded to the comment and called him an idiot. Cue to mother's husband leaving the fiancee a voice message threatening to go to his place of work and beat him up. "" You better have the cops there waiting for me"" type of threats. Oh boy.
The anger issues have always been notable. My mother and her husband are yellers: they tell when they're happy, they scream when they're mad. I have talked to my mother many times about how the yelling can affect the kids. I myself will not stay over at her home for any length of time because loud sounds have now become a trigger for me. 
My sisters (15 &amp; 16) and mother are always walking on egg shells. They have told me many a times to not address certain issues with my mother out of fear of retaliation in the home. Issues like not taking my sisters to doctors appointments when they've expressed worsening asthma due to the fires, and letting them use expired inhalers (exp. 2019) rather than taking them to the doctor. In addition, the house is filthy: three cats and four dogs (3 of which are Great Danes), an inch of dust coating their hard-line collections of random shit. My sisters (15 &amp; 16) complain of the animals urinating on their bedding and their clothes are always covered in the smell and hair of the animals. 
Whenever my sisters come over, they make statements, expressing their desire to come live with me and my partner, who has been with me for 7 years. I am an RN, finishing up my Bachelor's, and my partner will soon be done with his law enforcement program. Our home is modest: 2 bed/1 bath but it's clean and quiet. My partner and I do not argue (sure we disagree, but it's never loud or hurtful). I have an established therapist and psychiatrist that I have been seeing for 5+ years to work through the issues I lived through as a child. 
I really want to get my sisters out of that environment. I do not know how to begin. I worry that, even if I was to attempt to obtain guardianship, my sisters would face worsening emotional abuse at home due to retaliation. There is no way my mother would let them leave willingly. I have looked into emancipation,  but since they're both younger and would have no income other than ours,  I don't forsee it being successful. To clarify,  we would take care of all of their financial needs until a time when they're either graduated and moving out by choice, or when they're done with college. 
I'm sorry this is so long and rambling; I am so conflicted. I feel as if I have failed to protect them from the childhood I went through. The thought of them living in that environment makes my stomach queasy. I just want them to be happy and carefree kids.

Last school year,

my daughter begins to be harassed and bullied by another girl, both in 5th grade. Starts with standard verbal stuff. Then escalates to violence; my daughter has taken Brazilian Jiujitsu since she was 5 but knows you do not use it unless everything else has been exhausted. My daughter does nothing lets herself get beat up; we go to the school they say they will keep them separated. I give my daughter permission to do what she has to do, and she cannot let anyone touch her anymore. Three weeks from the end of school, the girl hits my daughter in the back of her head with a hard-covered dictionary as hard as she can. My Daughter puts her in an armbar until it's broken up. She gets punished despite everyone acknowledging the other girl started it.

The next day things get taken to the point of no return. The girl walked up to my daughter and told her to watch her back as she will bring a gun to school and shoot her and anyone in her way. This is reported to the gym teacher and her actual teacher. During this time, the teacher does not report it further, takes my daughter and the bully out of the room where she then makes them hug, telling my daughter that it was her fault for putting her in an armbar the other day, and the girl didn't mean it.

My daughter, terrified when she gets home, tells my wife and me about the incident. We then contact the principal; she apologized that it wasn't escalated to her as those threats have to go all the way to the police. The school district starts an investigation; we do some interviews. We end up in some interviews with the teacher who made them hug and the investigators (not police investigators). The teacher again says this was because my daughter put her in an armbar and that it wasn't a big deal, and they even hugged. My daughter, without anyone saying anything, interrupts her and corrects her saying the fight was because she hit me in the head with a book; we are not friends, I did not want to hug her, but you made us. The interview is over at that point

We request an in-school district transfer for my daughter as she was scared for her life from the girl. A couple of weeks from the new school year, we get the report from the school district. It is a by-the-word statement from the teacher who wasn't there when it happened, and it even said she witnessed them hug after the event, no mention of other witnesses or my daughter's statement.

They then acknowledged the threat is serious but are denying the school transfer, but have a plan in place to protect my daughter and make sure she never has to interact with the girl.

The school year starts, their plan is as follows my daughter is removed from her class with her friends; she does not get to eat with her friends; that is their solution. Then comes the bus ride. They assign the bully to the seat behind my daughter on the bus, the bully tears my daughter's backpack and steals some items from her, my daughter refuses to defend herself because she tells me she does not want to be shot (honestly broke my heart when she said it). We contact the school, and they said they would fix it; their solution is to put my daughter on another bus that drops her 1.5 miles away from our house. I email them talking about how this was unacceptable, and how we have worked with them despite the mistreatment of my daughter not only by the bully but the school in their response to this.

They then put her back on the bus that drops her off about 100 yards from the house and moves the bully to the back. Another incident occurs where the girl steals my daughter's house keys and mocks her. They then remove the girl from the bus for 24 hours. Today the girl is back on the bus mocking my daughter, and the school is now committed to going with the plan that drops my daughter off 1.5 miles away.

(The last two paragraphs have happened the last two weeks.)

Every step of the way the school has done nothing but make decisions that have isolated my daughter has made her feel like she is the one being punished as her life has to change constantly or be inconvenienced. while the bully gets to do whatever she wants

I am done with this and I want to just sue them at this point, their response and plans have caused more psychological harm and they even failed at the plan outlined in their report. If they can't hold people accountable then I will do my  best to

She is not physically abused, but emotionally abused which is the obvious reason why it’s so hard to get her help with how hard it is to get evidence for emotional abuse.

They are anti-vaccinists, homophobic, racist, and discriminatory towards other religions (and they are Christian, not sure which Church). I am not a therapist, psychiatrist, doctor, or any health official in general but I have a feeling that she has severe untreated ADHD as she couldn’t even sit through the Helluva Boss Pilot, which is about 11 minutes long. Her parents hate her because of her sexual identity and her religion as an atheist. She is severely bullied and some people have attacked her, and I don’t know how she even manages. She wasn’t able to stay with her siblings, and the rest of her family lives in Maryland, and they’ve tried to get custody of her and failed. That really broke her.

I told them I would double check my credit card statement, thinking there was a mistake, but the payment had been cleared and I had already paid the other 1/2 in cash. I was also in the shop multiple times since my wedding and no one had said anything. 

Five years later they are now taking me to small claims court. I called them and they advised me that unless I can produce the two receipts in court, I am going to lose. 

I asked them why they would have given me my suit if it wasn’t paid for; they told me it was a “human error” and it was because of a new employee. This is a lie as we were serviced by their most experienced staff member. 

I obviously didn’t save either receipt from over five years ago. I’m sure I could get ahold of the old credit card statement but not the cash receipt. Maybe their employee pocketed the cash; I have no idea. 

Can you please advise?

My wife and I own a home in a small town on a street that goes up a small mountain and loops around to form a closed neighborhood. We have a few empty lots next to us. There is an area for a road to potentially be built intersecting just past our home/lot that would go down the hill and connect to the rest of the town. As of now, it's just dirt and woods, but if you look at blueprints and other town documents, there's clearly a plan for a road here.

We are planning on buying the lot directly next to us in order to try and slow down development. We have a verbal agreement with the man who owns the lot and actually have a closing date (Sept 1). This lot adjoins the potential road. Today we got an email from a lawyer saying that he represents the developer and he said ""I believe you are buying it as a buffer and do not need any easement over the (developer) property to access it. Please confirm.""

Now, I really don't want any more development to be done here on my one single street, there's plenty of land in my town of 5,000 people, and we bought this house precisely because it was somewhat private. What exactly does he mean when he says he wants us to confirm we don't need an easement? Can I request an easement on a road that doesn't yet exist? Please advise.

To sum it up, I was hired at Walmart a little over a month ago to work in the electronics department. Before I was hired I was told stocking positions made $13 an hour and electronics made $11. I didn’t get any details about the job besides pay because there was no interview due to their COVID protocol.

Well it’s been a month and I haven’t even set foot in the electronics department. I’ve been stocking the entire time, with no end in sight. I understand I need to be a team player and I don’t mind working different areas but I specifically chose what I did because I didn’t want to stock all day, and if I had known I was going to do nothing but stock anyway I would have just applied for that position and made more money. I have a hard time lifting a lot of what they’re asking me to stock and it’s getting hard for me to do this 40 hours a week.

When I brought up my concerns I was told “well honey this is Walmart. You’re going to be all over the place.” Which again would have been okay, but if I’m hired to work in electronics, and my schedule says electronics training, then I don’t feel like it’s unreasonable to assume I’m going to be in that department.

Up until last Friday I worked for a small district management company. Basically we did the admin work for covenant- or HOA-controlled communities. There was me; my boss, A; K, A's fiancee; and S, K's sister. Small company. 

There was friction between K and I since day one almost. This all came to a head after about two weeks straight of nothing but negative feedback. She sent me an email detailing the struggles I was having, and said she wanted to put me on a development plan. I mistakenly thought she was trying to open an honest dialogue, so I responded (arguably too) honestly. That backfired and she stripped me of 3 of my primary duties and didn't speak to me for the rest of my time there. (I know, it's almost *too* professional.)

So for the remaining 6 or 7 weeks, I'm basically A's assistant. That's fine, we get along, and my days are pretty empty. Eventually I get laid off, which I anticipated. And thanks to A laying me off instead of firing me, I'm able to receive unemployment benefits.

My question is: when I signed my contract, it was agreed that I would make X per hour, then after a 6 week probation period, I get bumped to Y per hour. The probation came and went (this was before everything went to shit) and no raise. Long story short, I never got the raise. It can be argued that I was only doing enough to warrant X per hour, but the cold fact is that the contract we all signed promised me Y at a certain point. 

Do I have any sort of case here? I'm torn, because I imagine any lawyer's fees would eclipse the amount I'm owed (a little over 2k). But that doesn't change the fact that the company was in breach for months, and that I'm unemployed in the worst job market since the Great Depression. And A is a super nice guy so I don't want to put him through that stress. (If you're curious, the money doesn't come out of his pocket; my salary was paid by one of the larger district we managed, who gave A a lump sum to hire an administrator.)

Monday morning around 3:30am my car was hit by another car passing by and caused it to be undriveable. The driver ran off and I do not know any identifying information other than a neighbors door step cam that provides a very vague image.

I travel for work and noticed the damage as I was heading to an Uber for the airport. I delayed my travel about 3 hours to file a police report and contact insurance. I do not have collision coverage on my aging car with the expectation I would be driving if it were ever damaged. In my rush for the airport and shock of the situation I forgot my lack of coverage. This is where my fuck up happens: A tow truck arrives on scene shortly after police and offers to tow my car to a local body shop. Thinking it would be covered by insurance, I oblige to get back to my flight and continue the heavy workload I have. I asked the body shop to quote me for repair of the car and another quote for  selling to a bidder as is. It was after the tow that I figured out my lack of coverage. They called me back yesterday and are asking for $1500 for the tow and a daily storage rate of $150. I feel like a complete idiot at this point for not being knowledgeable about my insurance plan and for allowing this shark to take my car.

My AC is in my attic so I called out a few AC companies to inspect as I imagined this is where the leak was coming from.

Work for a large healthcare system that is fairly transparent about pay. 

Each job title has a ""pay grade"" which is searchable on the employee intranet where you can see the payscale including the min, med, and max pay for any title in that pay grade.

My position is fairly new but becoming more frequent throughout the organization. I was hired 2 years ago. Let's say I was hired to a job code of Admin-101. This is equivalent to say an hourly wage of min 20, med 25, max 30. 

My job requires, let's say, 5 years of experience in the field, 3 years of experience in the specialty,  masters preferred (I know, the ""preferred"" is a scummy way for them to not pay you for your degree).

I have been advocating for higher pay since hire, negotiating during interviews and when I was offered. The pay is the equivalent grade to a much easier job type that has much fewer requirements. 

I have continued to compile reasons why I should be paid more, including job tasks that go above the description that have since been put on my plate, cost savings my position has created for the organization (in the 2 - 3 millions per year) and quality data showing improved outcomes since this job was created. I am the only person in my department that holds this job. 

I finally saw a job with the same title posted but in a different, slightly more profitable department. However, in other positions in this organization, regardless of the department same job title = same pay grade. 

The job posted requires, let's say, 3 years experience in the field, only 1 in the specialty, no master's preferred. 

It is, let's say, and Admin-103 pay grade with the following pay scale: min 25, med 30, max 35. It is equivalent to 10k difference a year. 

I went to my manager with this job opening in hand to use as evidence of a pay disparity. She requested a pay review, and that was about 2 months ago. I found out today I will hear back in October (two months from now). 

I have found out since seeing this job offer that other people with the same job title in different departments are making 40k more and are salaried, not hourly. This made my blood boil. 

I do this job because I care about the population i work with, but I also know there are only about 8 people in a 2 hour radius who can do this job, and none of them are interested, and sure as hell would not take the job at this pay rate.

 I am disabled but am not sure that played a role. I am a woman, but the other positions are held by women too. 

Any advice is welcome. Do I go to HR? Do I get a lawyer? Or will that likely lead to retaliation and blacklisting by the organization?

I like my job, I want to keep my job, but I also want to be paid more than a near entry level position that had much less responsibility. I also want backpay. Knowing that I have foregone ~20k over the last 2 years while people with the same exact title were getting that money is pretty demoralizing.

I also feel my manager is getting frustrated with me for asking for review. I have been also letting her know (per her request) that I am applying for other jobs and likely will receive offers in the next two weeks. I am also letting her know because when I leave, my department will be at least temporarily, screwed.

I asked the landlord and they promptly called to tell me they had an inspection and had to get rid of it. 
And so threw it and whatever else was back there away.

Long redundant story short they refused to accept what i thought would be the logical recourse of reaching out to tenants to give them the chance to remove it themselves or just take the propane tank away (which was nestled inside but disconnected) as that was the thing the inspection took issue with. 

They refuse to replace it and won’t even speak to me because as they say “I am wrong and just complaining”

I’m wondering if there is any legal recourse to this? I would imagine the costs of small claims court would supersede the cost to just replace it. Is there any way to hold them accountable?

My neighbor on the bottom floor directly beneath me has been a nightmare. She was caught by the complex smoking (Community has banned smoking within 100 yards) and was served with eviction papers. Let me preface by saying I have never, not even for a quick hello, had any contact with this woman before this. She blames me (totally not me) for ""snitching"" on her. She came to my apartment door 2 weeks ago and tried to kick it down to attack me screaming ""I'm going to kill you MFR"". I have gotten this on video and submitted it to the police.  


The police arrested her, and filed a TRO for ""violent harassment"", but because of covid she was released within 2 hours of being arrested. Fast forward to today, I'm leaving my apartment to walk to the store and she blocks my exit from the building and threatens me. I carefully brushed passed her and walked faster to get away from her, while she was screaming ""I'll be right here when you come back mfr"".

A neighbor called the police on her for an unrelated matter (her boyfriend was doing drugs on the balcony) and when I arrived back at home from the store they were there. I told them what happened and that I had a TRO, and they took a statement. Later I see her walking around outside of the building staring at my window with a death glare and call the police to ask how come she wasn't arrested. They told me that it was ""my word versus hers"" and that unless they have proof they won't do anything.  


I then went to the apartments leasing office to see what could be done about this on their side. They were very blunt and said ""She's being evicted but it could take 60-90 days because of the moratorium. In the meantime just call for a police escort if you want to leave your apartment"". I wish this was an exaggeration, but they explained that the only thing they are responsible for via safety is ""to make sure the door closes and locks and the windows can be closed"".   


So now I have this crazy lady who has attempted to attack me, break down my door, block my way from leaving, who is now empowered to continue doing these things because no one will hold her accountable.  


My question is, what exactly do I do now? Do I just wait for her to attack me? Do I arm myself and defend myself the next time she confronts me since there are so many paper trails showing I tried every avenue to protect myself before this? Do I stop paying rent because my apartment isn't a safe environment? Do I take on extra costs that I can't afford to find a new place to live?  I feel like I'm being held hostage in my own apartment, and am worried what someone who acts like this will do if given time to plan an attack.",legaladvice,(CO) I am renting an apartment and my neighbor tried to kick in my door.

Last April, a family friend passed away. We had been visiting him regularly for the last 5+ years, keeping him company, helping take care of him, etc. 

He wanted to set up his house for his niece (Jill), wanted the floors redone, carpets ripped out etc. My father knows how to do this type of work, was asked to do the work for some sort of payment. My father and his friend worked out a deal (while he was alive) that my dad would do the work, and in return would receive appliances: stove, washer/dryer set, fridge, etc. 

So, this was the deal they both agreed on, in a completely lucid state. My father did the work, and received the payment agreed upon. Four months after the fact, his family comes around and wants the house, the money to the house, the contents of which were inside and state they’re getting a lawyer to sort this out.

We looked at the handbook and it stated “Upon voluntary separation from employment, team members may be eligible to be paid for accrued and unused PTO. PTO will be paid in up to 40-hour increments per week per pay period until it is paid out. This applies only in locations where not prohibited by law. Team members will not be eligible for this PTO payout if: they did not provide adequate notice and/or did not leave in good standing or have been discharged for cause (with “cause” to be determined solely within the discretion of [company]” upon bringing this up to my manager we both were under the impression that I would.

 None of those ineligible things were applicable to me as I had given ample notice, and had nothing on my record as being in bad standing and that it was a voluntary separation

However there was another clause that stated “Upon separation, unused PTO will not be paid out unless specifically called out by local or state guidelines.”

I had looked up my states laws and although it doesn’t have a specific must pay out, there was a Supreme Court ruling of Hall v Plainview which summarized that a general contract disclaimer in an employee handbook did not, as a matter of law, nullify a breach of contract claim with respect to a paid time off (PTO) policy within the handbook. 

I was wondering if I should pursue this further as there was a guideline in place in regards to pto during the time I signed the acknowledgment of the handbook or is that guideline not really stating that I am entitled to my pto in the way I think.

There is a 5th phase of the community which had been platted, but not deeded, at the time I certified &amp; recorded the amendment.

Membership shall be appurtenant to and may not be separated from ownership of any Lot.

I’m currently on Maternity Leave until the beginning of October and my husband and I have been thinking about me becoming a stay at home mother in addition to moving in with and caring for our in-laws (in case this is important information to provide to my employer as an additional reason to leaving). I remember reading somewhere that an employer can make you pay back your benefits and/or your short term disability salary (including Family Bonding salary amount) if you leave your job after returning from maternity leave. I’ve tried searching online for any information for this but I can’t seem to find anything. In addition, while I’m on leave, I can’t seem to access my company’s employee handbook. I have no idea if this applies to my company specifically or if FMLA protects against something like this too (again, tried searching information re: no return to work after maternity leave using FMLA protection and still couldn’t find anything).

Any help regarding this is much appreciated. Thank you!

Edit: I wanted to keep looking up information in the meantime, and I think I found information from a website called Nolo.com: “ You might have to pay back your health insurance premiums. If your maternity leave was covered by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), your employer was legally required to continue your health insurance benefits during your time off. If you decide not to come back from leave, your employer has a right to seek reimbursement of any money it paid to keep your health benefits in place. In this situation, you'll have to pay back not only the company's share of the premium, but also your share of the premium—if you failed to pay it and the company paid it for you. However, this right to reimbursement does not apply if you return to work for 30 days or more. Some states family leave laws have similar reimbursement provisions.”

I am wondering the legal ramifications my aunt may face due to her current situation. She is currently married to a US citizen and lives here in the United States.

When I bought the car, it was the middle of COVID, I bought it from my mechanic in California before moving to New York (where it was sold), and I was working from home, so I was not driving it. In addition to that, because I wasn't a NY resident yet, I couldn't register the car online. Eventually, after waiting for the offices to open and allow me to schedule an appointment, I just decided to sell the car. I called the DMV and made sure everything was good and legal even though I never registered it and they said it would be fine with all the correct paperwork. Then I found my buyer, we met up, I gave him the paperwork (everything I got with it, the original title, and a bill of sale), he paid and and I left. His dad was worried about registration issues so on the bill of sale, he added ""Seller will cooperate with buyer to register vehicle in NY. If not able to register in NY, sale canceled and money will be returned"".

&amp;#x200B;

The buyer has been to the DMV a few times and there was an issue with the bill of sale, so I got him a new one as soon as I could so that issue was solved. I also offered to pay his registration fees, as he was working well with me, and being patient. Cut to today, he calls and tells me that he went to the DMV today, and they told him that because it has a salvaged title (he knew before he bought it, and it is on the title) he has to do an inspection that can take up to 3 months to complete. He is now asking for his money back because he doesn't want to wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, am I obligated to give him the money back? The terms they put on the bill of sale stated that if it COULD NOT be registered, I would return the money. However, it can be registered, it is just going to take awhile. (For the record, I had no idea this would be such a process, I'm from California and registering a salvaged title there isn't a big deal, otherwise I would've done this all before selling).",legaladvice,"Terms and Conditions on Bill of Sale, am I obligated to return money-- New York",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8e2z5/terms_and_conditions_on_bill_of_sale_am_i/

First time poster so let me know if there is more information needed for this. I am posting this on behalf of my partner, let's call him Q. So Q and his ex (M) were never married. They have a child together. I do not have too much details on whether there is an official custody agreement between them, but I suspect there is as they went to court a couple of years ago to establish 50/50 custody. Both Q and M lived in Pennsylvania and recently Q and I moved to Delaware. M claims that because Q moved out of state, he no longer has legal rights to where their son is enrolled in school. Without Q's consent, she has enrolled their son in school in New York state to live with her parents for the next two years while she completes a program for her schooling.

Q is not opposed to their son living with mom full time. However, he is opposed to their son living in New York with grandparents where he would not be able to see him regularly. Originally, M suggested their son come live with us in Delaware while she is in school, which Q and I were both very excited about, but she later changed her mind. He was fine with her keeping him in Pennsylvania with her but is now considering legal representation since she has now, without his consent or without discussion with him at all, decided to enroll their son in school out of state and live with her parents.

My question is, is she legally allowed to do this and what steps might my partner need to take in order to have their son enrolled somewhere closer, either in Pennsylvania or Delaware? Are there any unexpected negative legal consequences that might result from bringing this to court? I am anticipating the legal fees, but I could also imagine potentially he might lose 50/50 custody if both parents are now living in different states. Previously they had a pretty casual custody agreement between the two of them where they'd take turns depending on either parents' schedule so neither of them had really been adhering to the 50/50 thing for years.

I have no Obligations and I gave them written notice. But they said they are unwilling to terminate my Agreement. They keep saying that the Agreement survives the Account closure. I heard this line a few times in different ways from customer service reps (all via email):

My understanding of that line is that closing your account does not terminate the agreement. It was actually that line that made me want to terminate. But it really doesn't seem like it says I cannot terminate.

It seems like they've breached the Agreement? Is there anything I can do? Or should I just consider it terminated because I've paid my Obligations and given notice?

Wednesday evening, an officer arrives at my house and gave me a number to call of an officer from Connecticut, where the Target was. When I was given the number, I was told it wouldn't be serious, and my father said the same. If he did, I can only hope he heard it from the officer, and I can only hope the officer wouldn't do something like lie to me about it not being serious either to keep me calm.

When I got another call after trying and failing to call him a few times, he told me that he needed the contact information of the people in the car with me, which I gave him, and that he'd call me on Saturday, as he had the next few days off. That's tomorrow, and I'm terrified.

That resulted in a fine that i paid at a reduced amount and was placed on a deferred disposition. The terms of it was that i was not able to receive a moving violation during that time period and that i must provide the court with a copy of my insurance to have on file. I paid the fine, maintain financial responsibility and didn’t get any moving violations. When i went to pay the fines i took my insurance copy with me. Upon paying the clerk asked me if my address on my license was my current address and i told him no but that the address on my insurance paper was. So he took the paper and started typing from it, so it seemed. After that, i was told that everything was good and i just had to not get a ticket during the time of my disposition. 


Fast forward to now last week and i get a letter in the mail from the dps office stating that my license was going to be suspended due to lack of insurance. Apparently, the judge filed a conviction because there was no copy of my insurance on file with them so it just looked i wasn’t covered. I contacted the court and explained that i did all that i was told to do in regards to having this dismissed.  She instructed me to go and speak to the judge in the morning, so i did. When i get there, she asks for my insurance so that she can verify that i had coverage during my deferred disposition dates. But when my insurance is contacted by the court to confirm my coverage, the court is being told that i did not have coverage during the dates they were requesting. Now i know this isn’t true because i hadn’t had a lapse in my coverage since my policy started. So i called them to confirm my coverage and they confirmed it with me. I asked why did they tell the court something different and the guy said whoever they spoke to may have pulled the wrong files or something, he wasn’t sure. Judge #1 is who requested the proof and coverage and was told that i was not covered. After speaking to my insurance and being sent proof that i was in fact covered during the requested time, i had to set a new time for a court walk in and by that time Judge #1 was gone. Judge #2 is now signed in to look over cases and sees that Judge #1 had already made a decision based on them being told information that was false. I was trying my hardest to plead to Judge #2 that Judge #1 was told incorrect information and that i had valid proof to back me up but they weren’t budging because of Judge #1’s review and decision. 


To go back, the letter i received from the dps was dated 8/05/2021 but i didn’t physically receive it until 2 days ago. It stated my license would be suspended started 8/24/2021. It turns out that the court has been sending notices to appear to the wrong address (the old one on my license). I explained to the judge that the clerk had asked me if my address is current on my license and i told him no but on my insurance it is. He was supposed to take my insurance and scan it into the system but he did not. I thought he was typing in my updated address into the system, but he did not. So when i wasn’t appearing to court dates i didn’t know about because of notices being sent to the wrong address, the judge filed for conviction on my case and it’s been more than 30 days since it was signed on so that means the court no longer has jurisdiction. My question(s) to all of this is 1. Who has jurisdiction now? 2. Can anything be done about this? I feel as though my license is going to be suspended for something that wasn’t my fault. I did the necessary steps to have this dismissed. 


tldr; Court clerk didn’t update my address when he asked me if it was current, didn’t scan my insurance to be kept on file, court sees no insurance on file so they put in a order of suspension on my license. Judge #1 requested to verify coverage with insurance company but was told i was not covered. I obtained proof to show that the judge #1 was misinformed but Judge #2 wasn’t trying to hear it. Once they call and no matter what they are being told, that’s it i guess. Can’t go back for whatever reason. Any advice on how to go about this? Is there a way to reverse the suspension? I’m being told that i have to file for an SR-22 from my insurance company but that will make my rate go up. Again, i’d like to stress the fact that there are no lapses in my coverage.

My fiancee's family home is on the line and she's been living there since she was a kid (her father moved out in October and let me move in because I had already asked for her hand in marriage).

&amp;#x200B;

 The original plan (when her father moved out and I moved in) was for us to stay here and pay 1/3 of the mortgage plus all bills while her father pays the other 2/3 (we're in SoCal so this is an absolute blessing) while we saved up for a down payment on a condo. With this setup and the COVID student loan freeze, we've been able to pay off about 32k in debt since March 2020 between the two of us (we make 145k between the two of us). This prompted her father to consider us financially responsible and offered to,  when the dust settles, ""sell"" us the house if we agree to pay 70% of the remainder on the mortgage so that we can focus on our educational goals (we both are considering graduate school when our careers get to a point where it becomes necessary), as well as having kids within a few years of us getting married (we're both 28). 

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, before Covid, the mortgage on the house was more than the house was worth due to a refi if I understand correctly. The wife expressed disinterest in the house because she had nothing to gain and since my in-laws own apartments in Mexico she moved there instead. Now that the market is exploding, the house is actually worth enough to have about 200k worth of profit than when divorce proceedings began late 2019. Now she says she does have an interest in the house and wants us to move out so that it can be sold for that profit and it be split (after the cost of sale) between my in-laws. 

&amp;#x200B;

For this reason, my fiancee is not on speaking terms with her mother. My mother in-law has been speaking to her daughter through me as I have chosen not to get involved in decision-making regarding their mother/daughter relationship. I have been providing my fiancee with emotional support and have made it clear that whatever she feels is the best for their relationship is what I will support . Today, her mother came over while my fiancee was at work because she knows I WFH. She dropped of some of my fiancee's favorite snacks as a ""peace offering"" but really she was here to talk to me about what her position is. I told her how my fiancee feels and when she mentioned that she wants her half of the house no matter what, I said ""well, instead of buying a condo and starting from scratch I'd rather just buy your half of this house"". She actually seemed a bit receptive of that as our conversation was cordial and calm.

&amp;#x200B;

My question now that I have provided context is: We only have about 12k saved up so far for a condo (we focused on paying off debt in 2020). Is there a way (if the mother in-law agrees to it) to buy her half (let's assume its 100k) by giving her the 12k as a down payment and paying her as if we had a mortgage (maybe 3k a month until we pay off the remaining 88k)? Obviously this would be done through the courts and backed by a contract that protects us from her backing out half-way through the agreement or any other potential situations where this could go wrong like her wanting more if the house increases in value, etc. I just don't want to tax my fiancee with the emotional toil that something like this can potentially bring on her if her mother decides to either say no or change her mind half-way through.

State is Pennsylvania.

So charges were filed against me, without me knowing, and the officer put down an incorrect address even though my address has been accurate on my license for the last three plus years. As a result I didn’t receive the summons or whatever it’s called in the mail and missed the prelim hearing ( I believe that’s what it was but I’ve never been in legal trouble before and don’t know all the terms.) a warrant was put out and I was taken in on 8/4. I was released without having to pay anything for bail the next morning and the judge told me to apply for a public defender and my next appearance would be 8/25 I thought he said. Long story short I never got the public defender because the older secretary messed up my income info immensely and I was denied twice even though I literally have ZERO INCOME.. so turns out my preliminary hearing was actually 8/18 so I missed it and have to turn myself in yo the sheriff.

2) Reckless operation

Only found out about this situation this week as all paperwork was being sent to an old address and I now live in NY.

Arraignment is next week, and I am told I “should” be able to attend via Zoom.

Even the couple of attorneys I have spoken to this far have not heard of any situation like this before. I’m having trouble finding a lawyer to help so far, but the search continues (via Avvo).

So charges were filed against me, without me knowing, and the officer put down an incorrect address even though my address has been accurate on my license for the last three plus years. As a result I didn’t receive the summons or whatever it’s called in the mail and missed the prelim hearing ( I believe that’s what it was but I’ve never been in legal trouble before and don’t know all the terms.) a warrant was put out and I was taken in on 8/4. I was released without having to pay anything for bail the next morning and the judge told me to apply for a public defender and my next appearance would be 8/25 I thought he said. Long story short I never got the public defender because the older secretary messed up my income info immensely and I was denied twice even though I literally have ZERO INCOME.. so turns out my preliminary hearing was actually 8/18 so I missed it and have to turn myself in yo the sheriff. I’m not guilty by the way and I was expecting the judge to say there’s not enough evidence against me to proceed.

So now I’m absolutely terrified and need to know what’s going to happen to me?? I tried to call a lawyer but he hasn’t called me back and I’m so scared.

i work for a company that pays a base hourly rate plus (mostly commission). The state of CA has allowed business to open in June, but we have been allowed to continue to work from home ( i love it ). Our manager is giving us employees an ultimatum; either come back into the office starting August 30th, or we can continue to work from home, but our hourly wage will turn into a recoverable draw against commissions, and we will be cut off from the inbound lead sources (we are in sales).   I  feel like with the covid resurgence it is foolish to have us come back in to the office environment. Also, my quality of life is so much better working from home. My sales numbers have not diminished during covid, in fact they are better now than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had the hearing. I sat in front of the judge with bank statements hoping to prove my consistent history of paying the fare. My defense is that I wasn’t willfully evading the bus fare, the OMNY machine was not accepting my payment and on the select buses, there are no opportunities to use the second method of payment as the OMNY policy recommends. 

The judge said verbatim: “Unfortunately I can only consider what happened on the Select Bus in question.” I don’t think she’s going to cut me any slack.

But during the hearing, I received a legible copy of the original ticket and realized the Agent wrote that the incident happened on August 14th but it occurred on August 15th. So, I scheduled another hearing requesting that the Eagle Team Agent is present. 

I’m not sure how to prove this happened on August 15th. I don’t even know where to begin. I have iMessages sent to my boss on the day of telling her that I’d be late because I got a ticket. Would that suffice? Could I request a copy of the Agent's work schedule from the information booth or something? 

Lastly, can I have the ticket dismissed because the agent wrote the wrong date? This is what I truly want to happen, though I’d be happy with a fine reduction.

A student is renting a room in a two bedroom unit. The roommate - who was assigned by the management -  is wildly incompatible (middle aged unemployed smoker and a bit unhinged - not completely on topic but why would they place a student with someone like this when the place is advertised as student living and 99% of residents are just that?). 

The student wants to move to a different apartment hoping for a better roommate situation. It’s doable but requires a $250 fee so they want to make sure they truly find a better roommate.

The management says they have a vacancy in a 2 bedroom so the student asks if the current resident is a fellow student or not. They are refusing to provide any information about the current tenant saying the fair housing act prevents them from disclosing that information.

Does this sound right?

Please any help and advice would be much appreciated. EDIT: Actual legal advice on how to respond to the summons, would be the best advice/insight.

In the mean time I filled out the application for this apartment and wrote I don’t have a dog because I wasn’t planning on bringing him. 
     After a month of looking I couldn’t find him a home and got ESA paperwork for him. I turned the ESA paperwork into the HOA and they approved him. My landlord today (separate from the HOA) said I need to get rid of my dog ASAP. I then sent him the paperwork and told him the HOA approved him. He then said if I hadn’t “lied to sneak in” my dog I wouldn’t have been approved to live there in the first place.

He does not live close by so he would not be able to make it down to visit me before the end of the summer which is why I booked in far in advance. I live in GA and the fishing charter is in TN. I found this fishing charter/tour guy on a TN travel website under"" things to do when visiting"". His website looked legit and he had mostly great reviews so I put a $700 deposit down and booked a date in June of next year. He had a few poor reviews from 2020 about him being late or no showing people and not returning their deposits, but stupid me I didn't really think anything of them. I figured with everything going on with COVID last year maybe there was two sides to the stories and he did have some amazing reviews from 2020 so I went ahead and booked anyway.

Well in the coming weeks, several really bad reviews began to pop up on his TripAdvisor page saying that he's a scammer and he no shows people and takes their deposit. I was contacted by several people who saw that I had sent my deposit to him via Venmo (another stupid move) that he scammed them. One of these people told me they're starting a class action lawsuit against this man as they went down to TN to film a TV show with him and lost a lot of money. This guy told me that I should ask the charter for a refund and if he refuses to return the deposit, then I could be part of the lawsuit. However, I am nervous to do this because there was no agreed upon cancellation/refund policy discussed and I'm afraid that if I just cancel he has grounds to keep my deposit. Should I wait for this charter to no show me next year and potentially look into small claims court? Or should I ask for the refund? I honestly have no idea how to go about this or anything to do court.

Edit: Forgot to include, based on what other's have told me, it seems that this man has developed a drinking or drug problem in the past year or so because he used to be one of the #1 guides in East TN.

I found them online with insanely good reviews, tons of 5stars, and they were just slightly cheaper than their bigger competition so I went with it. I paid half up front as they requested, and the other half will be paid upon delivery. I signed a contract that said I agree to pay, and that they will deliver my things between an estimated 17-21 days. I brought a few things with me and moved to the new state, assuming I’d only have to live off of the few things I brought for a short time. Weeks went by and I couldn’t get a straight answer about delivery. I got curious and looked up the google reviews and found a new review that was one star. I read about a woman’s horrible experience with this company and how they didn’t deliver her things for months, upon delivery doubled her payment and held her things hostage, and had to file a police report to get her things back. I took a look at the 5star reviews and realized they were all fake, complete with generic reviews left by generic names with stock pictures on their profiles. Horrified, I sorted by worst reviews and read countless stories exactly like the other: super late delivery, demanding more money before giving things back, and destruction of their property. One person included a picture of their dining table with all of the legs ripped off, smashed pottery and mirrors, dishware broken, smashed TV, and more. The company says they aren’t liable for any damage in the contract, but to what extent can they claim that??

Thoroughly freaked out, I stayed in constant contact with the delivery coordinator who, on day 25, admitted I wasn’t even on the delivery schedule. I asked him why I wasn’t considering my things were supposed to be delivered days ago. He said that it’s peak season and “not their fault or problem”. I was speechless - I corrected him And told him it IS their fault and problem because we have a contract that states my things *should* be here by now. He reiterated that it’s not their fault and hung up. I called back the next day and got no answer. A week and a half goes by and I can’t get the coordinator to return my calls. I leave a voicemail for their customer service team demanding a delivery date. The operations manager texts me the next day informing me that the coordinator “is in the military and has been deployed”. So none of my calls or emails were forwarded to anyone? I reiterate that I need a delivery date, as it’s been 38 days and I’ve already incurred a lot of expenses replacing things I already own just to get by for so long without my things. The manager tells me to check back later. At 41 days I call again and again demand my things or else I’ll consider them stolen. I’m told that I will have an answer about my delivery date before 9 am the following morning.

At midnight I receive a text from the company informing me that my things will be delivered that morning before 12 pm. I didn’t see this text until 7 am when I woke up - an hour before work. I get a call from the company informing me again of the delivery and I’m told my things had just been loaded up Last night and transported this morning. So it was always that easy?? I tell the company that I’m not paying them the other 50%, and instead will give them $500 simply for the labor of delivering and unloading my things. I told them that they did not adhere to the contract, therefore I am exempt from adhering to it. I’m told that they aren’t giving me my belongings until I pay the full amount. I told them that they’ll have to take the $500 or reschedule, because I wasn’t given adequate notice in the first place. 45 minutes later the driver calls me and tells me he’s an hour away and asks if I’m home and ready. I told him sure, and he asks if I’m aware of how much I owe. I explained that I was paying $500 and that’s it, and I had already told the company this. He’s confused, and was not told this. He calls the office and I next hear from the operations manager who asks me why I’m not willing to pay. He tells me that what I’m doing is “not the path I want to take” and tells me I need to pay. He says that I signed a legally binding contract, but they didn’t so they don’t have to adhere to anything. He says that if I have an issue that I can go through their third party claims service, but I need to pay first and then get money back after. I told him I believe this whole thing is a scam and I don’t trust him, and asked why I hadn’t heard about this before. He sends me the information and I tell him that I’ll call them first to validate legitimacy. Manager man tells me I don’t have time to call because he’s going to start charging me for waiting time. I told him I’m not paying any fees, because I wasn’t given adequate notice or time to prepare or get time off of work even if I had decided to go along with this. I call the number provided and Before I can get connected to anyone the call ends. I tried another 5 times and the call ended every time at the same moment. I’m 100% in panic mode at this point and In the mean time I’ve received several emails from the moving company reminding me that I signed a contract and I have to pay. I reply and told them I will give them $500 today or nothing, inform them of the third party claim scam I discovered and told them any further communication on the matter would be through my lawyer. The driver calls me another 4 times asking me to pay, and checking to make sure that I don’t want to pay. Why is the driver calling me asking me to pay?? I get another email from the company laying out a book of fees they’ll charge me - $150 for every hour I delay the move, and another $650 for each day, and an unspecified “re-delivery fee” before they give me my things. I get another email tallying up the fees I owe them for the day.

We have had a friend of the family living without a lease for the last 2 years in my husband’s deceased father’s home, which is not yet in probate. He has lived there by offering security for the home as well as keeping up the lawn in lieu of rent. This person wanted to buy the small home that is more like a shack (worth only $15,000), and was saving money to do that in the time he’s been living there. 

We check in with him every few months to see how much closer he is to buying the house and to make sure the house is secure, and when we reached out to him this month, there was no reply. We Googled his info on the internet and found that he is currently in custody at a county jail with no release date scheduled, being held on a quarter million dollar bond for 6 counts, including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. We also found that he had previously been charged with marijuana possession. Our relationship with him is severed because of this news, and we want him out. 

Our lawyer wants us to take a twofold approach. One, to secure the property and two, to move forward with eviction proceedings. 

To secure the property, he has suggested we drive to the home (3 hours away) and, without touching anything and while documenting EVERYTHING, see if there is any evidence of drug paraphernalia or weapons in view. If found, the lawyer wants us to call him immediately so we can call the authorities together. 

On the eviction front, the lawyer says that even though it was an informal verbal agreement, he can be seen as establishing tenancy on a month-to-month basis, and we need to give him a minimum of 30 days notice to vacate. He wants us (or better, himself) to send a letter to the person in jail letting him know that we understand he’s incarcerated and as a consequence cannot enter the property. Inform him that we have changed the locks to avoid squatters. Should he be released in the next 30 days time period, let us know, so we can let him in to gather his belongings. And, make it clear that we are giving him those 30 days to vacate.

I checked, and we don’t have to worry about not evicting him during the COVID moratorium because we are evicting him for his domestic violence and drug charges, past and present, that have now come to light that no longer make him a desirable tenant, rather than evicting for non-payment of rent, which is what the moratorium is for. 

This is obviously a very sketchy situation with a lot of potential pitfalls. Yes, we have learned to never do such a thing as letting a friend stay without a lease again. At this time, we just want to know the smartest steps to take to 1) protect ourselves and 2) gain possession of the property again. We want to know what we can do now to minimize the chance that the tenant may fight the eviction, and we also don’t know if we need to post an eviction notice on the property in addition to sending the letter.

I came in that Wednesday, and immediately my supervisor started yelling and basically being normal so I waited until he was done and handed him my resignation.   I have a little over 3 weeks notice.       My supervisor was no longer a jerk, it was a pretty decent work environment my last 3 weeks.     I finished out my term on a Friday and began working with the new employer the Following Monday.   


Things were great for the first month, and then got kind of sour.   I held on for another 2 months and they let me go.   


Here’s my question.   I applied for UI benefits the day I was let go.     I obtained a new job literally 2 weeks later. I filled out my claim form each week until I was hired.   I received notice that my first employer is contesting the UI claim on grounds that I voluntarily quit.  

I believe, I need to prove I left under good cause in order for my claim to go through correct?


I did not inform my previous employer I had a new job I only stated I was leaving for personal reasons.

My new employer had much better benefits,  it was cheaper, the deductible wasn’t as much, and they offered vision which my first employer did not.   

I received about a 4 dollar pay increase and went from hourly to salary.

The new employer let me go basically as a failure to adapt.     They are not contesting the claim.


I know my previous employer is contesting because as far as they know I left and pretty much retired.     I guess my question is do I just prepare myself to get denied? Or do I have a chance?",legaladvice,Unemployment Contested- Iowa,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8bnti/unemployment_contested_iowa/

&amp;#x200B;

Until earlier this year, I worked for a nonprofit that runs the dining halls for a large university in Kansas. I was let go a while back under suspicious circumstances, but decided to let it go until I ran into another employee who told me their story. I don't know much about employment laws, but the way that the company handled these issues raises some alarms to me.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I was let go from my position shortly after a change in leadership. After refusing to come in to work hours that I wasn't scheduled for (during the beginning of the summer, which I was not scheduled to work, as discussed in the interview for the position), my new manager called me and changed the description of my position for the coming semester (specifically the number of hours that my position would have to work moving forward), effectively turning it into a position that I could no longer qualify for, as I am a student and can't work 30 hours a week. If it's relevant, the position was for a part-time supervisor. Unfortunately, though these decisions went against the job description discussed in the interview, I don't have any written record of my position both not working during the summer and not working a minimum number of hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, my manager insisted over the phone that, by refusing to show up to the shifts, I would be resigning. I was adamant that I was not resigning, but that he could feel free to cite the attendance policy to terminate my employment if he wished. Unfortunately, after a long struggle with the company, I became tired of dealing with the issue and simply stepped down from my position in order to move on -- I know, it was stupid, but I have a better job now anyway. I just want to prevent this from happening to anyone else if it actually is illegal. When I stepped down from the position, my manager offered me a job that would be a significant demotion. I did not accept the job, though I also did not explicitly reject the offer at the time. I have rejected it in writing since then. This is very similar to what happened to my colleague; they were essentially coerced into stepping down, then offered a position with a laughable pay in comparison to their old position, which, of course, they didn't take.

&amp;#x200B;

I have just received a letter from the department of labor saying that I was disqualified for benefits because ""The claimant worked for ... non-profit organizations providing services to educational institutions in the last academic year or term, and the claimant has reasonable assurance of performing similar services in the subsequent academic year or term."" Now, since I was technically offered a position at the same nonprofit, maybe this is legitimate. But...

&amp;#x200B;

With 1. My manager being adamant that I was quitting, not being fired, and 2. Him offering everyone who was pushed out of their jobs positions that paid significantly less, it seems as though the company might be trying to cut down their labor costs while eliminating the risk of their employees successfully applying for unemployment benefits.

It was a full time job and they were needing my skill set to help support a new system implementation that just ramped up a month ago. 

During my job interview, the hiring manager told me that I needed to stay on board at least 18 months, to which I said “I understand.” When I accepted the job, it was a simple verbal acceptance and there was no mention of an 18 month timeline. I signed no employment agreement or offer acceptance letter. There were no written contracts of any kind. 

I quit the job because my boss (not the hiring manager) was terrible and drove me crazy to the point that it became a mental health issue. When questioned about why I was leaving by the hiring manager (without HR present, which I stated made me very uncomfortable), I told him basically that exact thing. He told me that since there were mental health concerns, I could go home that day and still be paid for the next 2 weeks - initially declined, but changed my mind the following day. 

Anyway, ever since I left (3 days ago), my boss and the hiring manager have been viewing my LinkedIn profile on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day. It’s making me nervous, and I finally blocked them both today. The only other employee who had been hired to support with this project quit the week before I did, so my subsequent resignation was really angering to them.

Long story short, as stated, I learned the company that acquired the property has a suspended FTB license. What does this mean for me?

**Legally close or dissolve your business**

**Bring an action or defend your business in court**

The supervisor was on medical leave the week after I started and came back to work this past week. On Monday he had a meeting with us and told us no more headphones are allowed. So of course I stopped wearing headphones and asked for earplugs instead which I started wearing. 

On Wednesday I got sick so I called out and went and got a covid test and informed them. They told me to tell them when I get my results so I did on Thursday and was told to come back to work the next day.  On Thursday night I’m told not to come into work on Friday and wait another day.

Today I get a phone call from the staffing company that got me this job telling me I have been let go. The reasons they were told by the company were: wearing headphones and complaints about my work ethic. 

I would also like to say that a month into working here an intern and someone who has been there for 10 years got into a verbal argument and resulted in the older lady getting fired (hr talked to me and asked for my side of story and I told them it- I wasn’t involved w the drama but it resulted in her getting fired) she was good friends w the supervisor so idk if it is related.

But my landlord is an Old Lady with some kind of mental disorder. I’m not sure what it is because I’m not a doctor and I don’t want to be mean but she is CLEARLY not all there. Her son I believe handles everything business wise, but she is the one who lives on property and is my point of contact (I do not have any direct contact with the son). Keep in mind that my apartment is on the ground floor of the complex, but in the back. I do typically leave my main window (that faces the common area) open so my cats can look outside at the birds.

She is doing a lot of little things that I’m not sure is legal, or at what point I should seek getting a cease and desist without worrying about landlord retaliation.

* Early when moving into this complex, I started getting a lot of solicitors and salespeople. I put a simple “No solicitors” sign (about the size of a bumper sticker) on my door. She complained, saying putting things on my door was a violation of my lease. She ripped it down and shoved it in my door crack. We eventually agreed that I can hang it in that window that faces the common area, from the inside. I have her agreeing to this in writing. Today, 2 years later, she yelled at me out of nowhere “are you still getting solicitors because that shit is making my property look cheap”. Again remember, it is probably 2”x6” sign that just says “No Soliciting”.

* The past year and a half, there has been a construction site on the building next door. It is not our building, but it is DIRECTLY on the other side of the wall I work from home on. Probably about 6 feet away from the outside of my wall. I am aware this is out of her control and not her fault, but something that has made it hard to sleep or work during the pandemic. I have seen her go out and yell at them before, because their nails and other gross dangerous shit has made it into our common area and they dont clean it up. A lot is right outside my front door on this property.

* A homeless person keeps digging through our dumpster. Not an issue for me, because whatever, that happens. But the locks to the dumpster keeps getting cut. She once came to my door while I was working to yell at me, alleging that I was leaving the locks unlocked, which is why they are getting cut open. She didnt understand the logic of “why would a lock get cut open if I was leaving them unlocked.” Either way, I’m not leaving them unlocked, and she had no evidence to prove otherwise, she was just taking her anger out on me because I was the closest door at the time.

* My $800 locked up bike was stolen off my front porch. Along with everyone else’s bikes. It was only at this point she told me the security cameras that face the common area aren’t real.

* There was a time she heard me working, saw me on my computer while on the work phone, and gave me a “formal volume warning” for “playing my video games too loud”. Granted, I keep the door open with the gate because I don’t have A/C, but there is no way I was being louder than the cement mixer that was at the construction site at the same time she did this. I was not “gaming”, I was on my work phone having a teams meeting. I have video of the mixer I took for my records, to show how loud it actually was that same day.

* She complains that I pay my payment on time, instead of early. She claims every other reisdent pays her with cash or a check they deliver to her door (she once suggested I just leave it in her door gate if she isn’t home), but I do not trust that so I use wells fargo bill pay to deliver a check to her mailbox on time every month, so the checks can have tracking. Sometimes it is a day or two late because of covid and mail delays, but we have a several day grace period, and when covid was at its prime in delaying mail, I moved the payment dates up sooner so it will arrive a little sooner than the end of the month just to be safe. She still complains to me that I pay “difficulty” and not just like everyone else. Also, because my checks arrive on their intended dates, and I’m not paying early, she has to “wait every month for my check before she can cash everyone else’s”. I do have written evidence of her getting mad at me for not paying her, only for her to find the check was just leaning on the side of the inside of the mailbox and she didn’t grab it. She even sent me a picture saying “false alarm” and I saved that for my records.

* As mentioned before, I do keep my window open facing the common area. Currently my fiancée is spending a few days at my place, and was playing minecraft on my computer. The landlord saw her in my apartment, through my window and stared at her, only to later ask full details on who I had over. Guests are not banned on my lease so long as they do not stay for 14 consecutive nights. I really feel uncomfortable with this, but dont know how reasonable I should feel my privacy should be when I have a window facing the common area with the blinds open like this.

* I have a neighbor who DESPISES this landlord. He has on many accounts had encounters with her where she went knocking on his door down the street to yell at him about something (I’m not sure of the details), and he has threatened to call the police on her. This neighbor and his wife also tell me they see her digging through our dumpster herself, probably to look at the addresses of not-broken-down-boxes so she can complain to that person.

* There was an incident when she was inspecting the inside of my apartment (legally), but got mad that my fridge had magnets on it and ripped them all down to make sure they weren’t damaging the fridge.

So there isn’t anything wrong with the property itself, besides her. The location and price are perfect for me, but I’m honestly afraid to call her if something like my ceiling fan needs repairs. It stresses me out every time I see her in the common area while I’m working next to that window, and now I need to worry about if my lady is there too? Because I don’t know when she will about face and knock on my door to
Yell at me about something stupid. I’m also nervous walking past HER on site apartment, because she might pop out to say hi like a nice little old lady, or she might pop out to scream obscenities at me because the guy painting the fence used the wrong color white and thats somehow my fault. I’m afraid if I retaliate with any form of legal “leave me the fuck alone” message, she will get worse. I don’t imagine she (or her son) are stupid enough to commit obvious Landlord Retaliation like a sudden eviction or rent hike, but maybe something like causing a scene or blaming me for damages if something like my water heater or ceiling fan breaks.",legaladvice,(CA) At what point is my landlord harassing me/invading my privacy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p8b187/ca_at_what_point_is_my_landlord_harassing/

Backstory:
A year ago I witnessed a staff member at the agency I work for commit a physical assault on a student. The staff member (Staff A) who committed the offense was fired. Staff member B (who was assisting Staff A in dealing with the escalated child before the assault) is friends with Staff A and would probably not be a credible witness for the agency. 

Staff A was denied unemployment and the agency’s denial was upheld in court. There were no criminal charges pressed against this person regarding the physical assault on the student. Staff A is requesting another hearing to contest the denial because this person denies that the incident ever happened. 

I am the only other adult witness to the event that occurred which resulted in Staff A being fired. The video footage of the event was lost when a server crashed and could not be used anyway due to the HIPAA rights of the student. 

Immediately after the assault occurred this person came to me and tried to intimidate me and gaslight me into thinking that what I saw didn’t happen. This person is mentally unstable and has a prior criminal record for petit larceny. I was told when this was first investigated that if it went to criminal trial that my private information would be a matter of court record (name, address, phone number). 

My question is: would my information be shared with this person as a matter of record in the unemployment denial trial? Do I have the right to say I do not consent to be a witness if they cannot guarantee me that my information won’t be shared? The agency has proof of prior supervision notes taken on this individual that shows this person has shown aggression to staff and students on more than one occasion.

I had found out that she was allowing him to go on sleepovers, right at the beginning of the pandemic, and that pissed me off. I called her some names in text and expressed my anger, and she decided that was reason enough to cut me off from my son for a solid 3 months.

So, I lawyered up. We went into mediation. She never saw any consequences, but I did.. now I have to pay child support. Let me add some information here.. I'm disabled, and I've been permanently and profoundly disabled since 2008. I have spinal issues.. I was born with Scheuermann's kyphosis, and scoliosis. Later on I found out I also have a rare disease called syringomyelia. Basically, there's a huge cyst inside my spinal canal.

On the flip side, the mother is able-bodied, but unemployed, because she lives on her new SO's income. To add to this, we have 50/50 custody and time (I actually have my son for more than 50% of the year). I live on the minimum disability payment, which is $700 a month. I'm beyond poor. I literally can't afford to live, and rely on assistance from my parents.

So I ask my lawyer, ""why am I paying child support? This makes no sense."" in an e-mail. I was ignored. I asked repeatedly, through email, in person (when I asked in person, at first he said ""oh yeah, you're right, I'll fix that"", but he didn't). Nobody at his office wanted to give me an answer as to why I'm paying child support. So finally, I send an angry email. I didn't swear, I didn't say anything disparaging, all I did was capitalize some words (like, ""I am DISABLED""). The person who read the email accused me of being abusive (lol), and of course my question went unanswered.

In addition, I've expressed my desire to get my son his own representation. They would bring in a third lawyer to counsel him. I know my son would rather live with me, so I want this to happen. My lawyer is the person who originally told me this was a possibility, and on about 4-5 occasions, he's told me ""let's do it!"" but then nothing happens.

You might be wondering why I didn't start looking for another lawyer. Well, I can't afford one, being on disability. My parents were helping with this. So I had to convince THEM that this lawyer was incompetent. Which turned out to be a hard sell.

I'd like to add that over the course of the year, he consistently forgot what my disability was, and compared it to some surgery he had on his shoulder over and over again. As recent as a couple months ago, I said to him, in person, ""I can't work"", and he replied, ""Until you get your surgery, I know"". No. If I do get surgery for this, I'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. It's a last-ditch effort. I've told him this numerous times by this point.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I had court. My lawyer didn't inform me (he had told me that he would let me know). It was concerning child support (son's mother is trying to get more...). It was over Zoom, so no biggie, I got dressed up real fast and logged on. I wasn't happy though, so I sent my lawyer an email that had ""wow"" as the subject, and only one sentence: ""Can't believe I wasn't informed I had court until 1 hour beforehand. Wow."" My lawyer responded within 10 minutes, and blew up, calling me ""abusive"" and ""ungrateful"". He said he couldn't believe I was so ""ungrateful for the generosity of his firm"". He said that I should be happy that he's helping me at all, because he's already been paid.

I respond, and try to do some damage control.. I say ""of course I'm grateful, but I'm being ignored"" in so many words. He says ""we can work through this"". For now, I don't respond.

Meanwhile I'm sitting there on Zoom waiting to be pulled into court. Court was at 10 am, and I was there from 9:45 until 11, waiting. Finally the judge pulls me in, and says ""your lawyer has been trying to get a hold of you all morning and couldn't"" and rescheduled court. My lawyer lied to the judge.

I decide I've had enough, and my parents agree. We start looking for a new lawyer. Meanwhile, I email current lawyer again, to ask my question about child support a final time. And then it happened: He admitted that he doesn't believe I'm disabled. In text. He said the judge will just ask why I can't get a job. In his words, ""How can you play video games, but not work?"" I guess he believes that disabled people lie in bed and stare at the ceiling 24/7. A judge and several doctors found me permanently disabled in 2008, but he says we won't be able to convince anyone.

So TLDR: Whenever I try to express dissatisfaction with my representation, I'm told I should be more grateful. When asking why I'm paying child support on a 50/50 arrangement, I'm told it's because nobody believes I'm disabled.

I have all the emails to prove all of this. I have copies of all the emails I sent, as well, proving that there's absolutely nothing abusive in any of them. This feels like I'm being discriminated against. I'm trying to find out if there's anywhere I can take this grievance. I tried the KY ACLU, but their website says they don't handle personal disputes.

So far, we have run everything expenses/revenue through a credit card and checking account under my name that we set up specifically for this business. We would like to form some type of partnership/entity, but having looked into this it gets costly very quickly to do so. We are operating with as minimal capital input as possible for the time being so obviously shelling out a couple grand to open an LLC, work with lawyers/CPA's is not ideal. We understand there needs to be some of that, but we would like to do so as minimally as possible. We are located in Texas and have done about $1,300 in sales through the first 20 days of being open. So still very early on in this thing.

We are looking for advice on a few things:

\- If we operate as a join venture and all record 1/3 revenue and expenses on our schedule C's, are we able to file like a DBA or something that way we have a legit business name to operate under?

\- Any advice on what type of entity we should form if we decide to go that route? Can we use a cheaper option like legal zoom to do so or is that pretty strictly advised against?

\- If we stay as sole props and operate as a joint venture, can we get a card/bank account that we all can access or does that not work since we are individuals? Same question for a sales and use tax cert..

We didn't do a viewing because we were coming in from out of state and properties are being snapped up at breakneck speed. We were struggling to find any apartment for us to live in on the day we went back.

We got the keys and we immediately noticed issues with the house. It was not cleaned. The dishwasher is broken. We called and complained and they sent someone over to clean the house. The dishwasher won't even be looked at until next week.

Over the next day we found locks that don't work, the washer/dryer won't work, some kitchen drawers have some sticky goo on them. This isn't what we imagined at all. We tried to call them up today and tell them about this but the leasing office said the property manager has to deal with this and he has a history of not calling back for days.

We let them know that if they were not issuing a refund, we would go home (about a 3-hour drive), follow every guideline to eradicate any exposure we might have had, and be back to use our non-refundable stay the following night. 

It was at this point that the innkeeper let us know that they had canceled our stay and would be barring our entry into their establishment as a ""public health issue.""

They claimed that they fixed the crack outside on the foundation, however I cant confirm this considering I haven't been there but I cant see any proof of such work, the bushes ar still in front of the area they would need to dig, the dirt doesn't look like anyone besides a squirrel as dug at it.

I have caught them looking through my windows several times, to the point where we had to block them with boxes and sheets. They told my landlord we have too much garbage here (all parties are aware I was doing a dump run Saturday) so they told the landlord he HAS to come today.

When I turned 18, I went to apply for student loans and student credit cards meant for building credit and was told my credit score was too low. This was surprising as I thought I should have any credit. Well I checked and my credit score was in the low 400s and I was in collections for 755 dollars for an account with the power company that was opened when I was 14. I called my mom crying and upset because I didn’t know what to do, she became very agitated and said to leave it alone and it will drop of my credit report. So I listened to her. My credit score is now in the high 700s, but the past still bothers me. I think my mom stole my identity and opened that account, possibly others, and set me up to fail in the beginning of my adult life. It would fit with other abusive patterns of behavior. I’m 26 now. Is there anything to be done legally? I’d like to get proof she did this so I can cut her out of my life with good reason so the rest of my family will back me.

This is California and they are claiming that they have determined that the project is ""categorically exempt"" from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, pursuant to Section 15304. Basically saying they don't even need to go through a permit approval process, some bureaucrat will make the decision.

So I looked up Section 15304 and it states:

&gt;Class 4 consists of minor public or private alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry and agricultural purposes. Examples include but are not limited to:  
**(a)** Grading on land with a slope of less than 10 percent, except that grading shall not be exempt in a waterway, in any wetland, in an officially designated (by federal, state, or local government action) scenic area, or in officially mapped areas of severe geologic hazard such as an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone or within an official Seismic Hazard Zone, as delineated by the State Geologist.

They are going to grade and repave the street so it's exemption 15304-a, but the header to the section explicitly states this section only applies to situations ""which do not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees"". These are healthy, mature, scenic trees, so are they wrong here? Do I have a case? How can I stop them?

Should I contact the town with my objection? Or am I just crazy?

Do I have any potential remedies if they violate the CEQA?

While the letter includes my plate number it misidentifies my vehicle. It notes the vehicle in question as an SUV. Mine is a compact car (I've never owned or even driven an SUV).

The letter also claims the incident occurred in an area I've never visited. I've never been to Chula Vista (unless my parents took me as a child 50 years ago).

The letter then proceeds to make the following threats: 

\- my vehicle can be impounded as evidence

\- a warrant will be placed on my vehicle

\- the DMV may suspend my driver's license

\- a warrant may be issued for my arrest

The letter urges me to contact the hit-and-run investigator ASAP ""in order to determine to what extent your vehicle may be involved.""

What should I do? 

If I was culpable, I'd hire an attorney outright of course. But this is a case of mistaken identity. No reliable evidence can exist. My car has never been stolen and I have never allowed anyone else to drive it.

Not one person has paid me to check about you.

in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).

When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.

immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.

after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.
Best solution would be to pay me $2632.


We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.

You could go on your life like this never happened and you will not ever hear back again from me.

You'll make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google).


if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.
I have taken care of my actions. i am not looking to ask you for a lot, i simply want to be paid.

if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.

Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.


If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.

I found out that she is messaging random acquaintances of hers of Facebook and begging for $20 and then degrading them and calling them names when they refused. She admitted to somebody that she’s homeless. I have the screenshots saved. 

I’m pretty sure she’s on some serious drugs but I don’t have any evidence of it yet. I don’t feel comfortable sending him with her. My son doesn’t even want to go. I’m not sending him.

They have not fixed our air and it’s been about a week. It has made this whole moving process horrible. My girlfriend and I were moving some more things today and we see a downstairs neighbor.

For a lease that ran from 6/15/20 to 7/1/21, I paid the first month (650), a security deposit (650) and prepaid the month of June 21 (650) because according to the realtor that oversaw selling/renting out the property, the OWNER (not the property manager) required 'first and last month' paid up front.

So I paid that; (I originally had a picture showing this, but I can't post pics in this subreddit)

Come to find out, I have read quite commonly that requiring prepaid rent to sign a lease is illegal?

As of this morning, I caught up some late months due to struggling finances. So as of this morning, including late fees, I am 100% caught up. I asked the property manager if the owner would be willing to continue leasing to me and if so, to send me a new lease (because as of July and August, I am on month-to-month). I live in the state of Ohio.

So, to clarify at this point, the entire term of the lease is paid for, including 2 months after the lease that were under month-to-month (July and August), this includes late fees I incurred for being late.

The response I got from him was that I needed to prepay 'the last month' of the new lease again in order to get a new lease. Specifically saying that I needed to pay for June 2022 in order for them to extend a new lease, otherwise the ""last month"" that I prepaid of my old lease would only count if chose not to seek a new lease with them.

I began seeing a dermatologist for a bump on my ass cheek in early May, after 3 visits to a dermatologist's office and a continuously worsening condition - I was given ""wait and see"" instructions. Roughly 36 hours later, I was septic and in the ER having emergency surgery for a severely infected abscess. I'd like to know the best path forward to cover out of pocket costs.

In early May, I noticed a bump on my ass cheek which would not go away. Soon after, I began experiencing fatigue and fever. Initially, I thought it might have been COVID despite being fully vaccinated at that point. However, after a negative COVID test, I began to believe it was from my mysterious ass cheek bump. I scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist which I had seen previously.

I had three appointments with this office for this condition on May 14, May 19, and May 21, 2021. During my first visit, I was given a shot and prescribed an antibiotic. On my second visit I was prescribed a different antibiotic and given another shot. On my final visit, the dermatologist attempted to express the now golf ball sized sore on my ass without success. I was instructed by the dermatologist there was nothing more that could be done, and we would have to wait for the antibiotic to take its effect.

Roughly 36 hours later, I was in such unbearable pain and misery; and asked my wife to take me to the urgent care.  The urgent care doctor, after a 5 minute examination, instructed me to immediately go to the ER for surgery due to the severity of the condition.  Upon admission to the ER (an hour later), my blood work indicated I was septic and I was fast tracked for emergency surgery to treat the abscess. Based on the comments made by the nurses and doctors, I could have been comatose within a matter of days had I not followed my gut and gone into the urgent care.

Outside of nearly losing my life, and the severe discomfort I was in for 72 hours prior to my emergency surgery - being unable to sit, unable to sleep, and unable to walk without excruciating pain (and the humiliation from almost going out this way): I was fortunate to have come out of this experience with no long term issues or problems. I had a short hospital stay, and my job is very accommodating for medical leave. I additionally have good insurance and only incurred roughly $3,500 in out of pocket costs.

I asked the dermatologist to cover my $3,500 out of pocket costs from this ordeal, and provided all available evidence which I had (invoices, medical records, etc). Their reply was no, and they deemed themselves to not be a fault and have no responsibility for my hospitalization.

I would like to be made whole on this experience, my understanding is this case is likely too small and minor to be of interest for a malpractice attorney. Which leaves me with small claims court. I've never done anything like this before. Can someone please provide me with guidance on a good resource to proceed? How do I initiate the process, how do I prove my case, how do I prove damages, what precedence/laws can I cite?

As an aside, I have filed a complaint against this doctor with the Georgia medical board.",legaladvice,Remedy for nearly fatal medical misdiagnosis,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p86xkr/remedy_for_nearly_fatal_medical_misdiagnosis/

I'm an apartment manager for a small complex. We have a dork that keeps parking in the fire lane even after being told to stop multiple times.

I would much rather do that than have his car towed because towing is majorly disruptive and I just don't have the heart to do it sometimes.

So I called the non-emergency dispatch and told them what happened. Soon after, a deputy called me and explained that there's nothing they can do because the fire lane is on private property.

I'm confused about this. If a murder is committed on private property they can certainly do something about that, right? I know a parking issue is far from murder, but I'm just using that example to make a point.

Context: After reading up on a few locally similar situations I still have a few questions to my personal situation that haven't already been covered. I live in the Fort Worth, tarrant county, area of north Texas and this year my complex has changed management. This is when things have started to fall apart. I should have know it was bad knews when they tried to say my lease ended a whopping three months before it actually did and still insisted my partner and I move as they did not want to turn away new tenants that were supposed to be getting the apartment we were still in. 

We managed to get a new unit with the same company at a cheaper rate and with no down payment for their mess up as it was last minute and the best option since this happened right after the Big Freeze. After moving to the new unit they never gave us a ""welcome home"" packet to check off weather or not the unit was to par, claiming it wasn't needed as it had been newly renovated in 2019. I argued we still needed one to no avail, I still took photo and video documentation as there were multiple things in this apartment not to par. The following maintenance requests I sent in for those things to be fixed were promptly ignored, along with my calls and emails as well as my partners. 

All of the things reported for maintenance is in the lease as the apartments responsibility to repair ""in a timely manner"". to date no request I've put in has been completed, and when prompted once by the management company to argue if one had been completed I was ignored when I said it hadn't been. Management continues to use the excuse that they only have a singular maintenance worker to fulfill all requests yet only seem to be focusing more on fluffing up and repairing the outward appearance of the complex. 

My question is essentially if there is anything I can do since contacting the management team and company is useless.  We are not in a position to move out right away as breaking the lease is a completely different beast entirely.

About 3 days after I initially took the car in, they contacted me to let me know the rear calipers, brake pads, and rotors needed to be replaced and quoted me $620. This seemed high but within a close enough range to what I expected that I agreed and told them they could start working on it.

A few days later, I called and texted to see how it was coming. No response. I called again the next day, no response again. I called again a few days after that and finally got someone on the phone. They claimed that when getting ready to fix the brakes, the car was dying repeatedly and they think the fuel pump needed to be replaced.

At this point it's a giant red flag, because in 5 years of owning my car, it's never had any problems resembling this and no symptoms of the fuel pump going out. It screamed scam to me so I told them to just finish up the brake work and I would bring it back later for the fuel pump if needed.

Now they are ghosting me. I have called probably 10 times and texted 6 times in the last 2 weeks. I've gotten a ride to their shop twice during business hours and both times the ""Open"" sign was lit but all the doors were closed and locked.

I've also contacted the number listed as ""emergency after hours problems"", the person who worked that job is no longer working that role. I've also contacted the direct maintenance line provided for our complex and the man work that job has also resigned. 

After a few attempts I got through to my landlord and she agreed to meet with me on Tuesday 8-17-21 at 3 pm. She did not show up, but 2 hours later a maintenance guy from another location did show up. The first time he was there he confirmed the fuse was broken and got the information to our landlord. When he showed up later the landlord had bought him the wrong fuses and he was unable to make the repair. The next day he showed up saying our fuse box was old and he couldn't find the fuses, so an electrician would have to come out and replace it. 

We haven't heard anything since, no plan or time table, and our living room is still without power. I was curious what our options are here, if I'm still unable to reach my landlord I dont know what to do. We had damage to property when the fuse blew and now with the old fuse box im afraid of damage to other areas or the house. I dont know where to go from here?

Originally California, but friend lives in Vegas now.


My friends ex has been terrorizing her for the past several years.

The kind of stuff he does is:

1. Calls and sends abusive texts constant even during the night.

2. He has cosigned for her apartment and has access to her apps in her house and will turn lights on and off, turn AC off and on, basically mess with her so she can't sleep.

3. He has cut the internet to her house by clipping the outside wires.

4. She has moved out of state and he will find her and travel across states just to mess with her.

She won't go into detail on why it was denied, I'd assume lack of evidence or she doesn't really want him to get in trouble. 

Id imagine most of this would be perfect for a restraining order, but if there's any advice on next steps or what to get to get it approved, I'd appreciate it.

I am looking for advice on how to handle a situation with the business that installed our screened in porch. We are located in Florida.

We (my husband and I) had our porch built in April of this year for a considerable amount of money. We noticed a leak after the summer rains started in May. It was above the patio door and looked like it was coming from the soffit. We called and spoke to the woman who answered the phone where they sent someone out to look at it. After inspection he told us that it was not the patio leaking but the roof. He said he put some sealant on and left. Come the next heavy rain we still noticed the leak and called again. This time a man and woman (same woman who answers the phones) came out where they told us again it was not the patio but the roof. We argued that we do not believe it is the roof as it is only a few years old, had been inspected less than a year earlier and that the previous covering that the company removed had never leaked. They again insisted it was a roof issue, put more sealant on and left. It was still leaking. 

We had a roofer come out in July and lo and behold it was not a roof issue but a leak in the transition metal on the patio, where they did not put sealant under a panel. He sent us photos and videos and told us they just slapped sealant on several shingles unnecessarily, stating it would have caused damage in the future due to water backup there. In addition to fixing the leak we had him replace those shingles and he charged us his base fee of $350. 

We are upset they completely dismissed us and didn't want to even try to put in the effort to fix a simple oversight. But are most upset they damaged the shingles and we had to replace them. We get things like this happen but the way it was (wasn't) handled was completely unprofessional. 

How should I handle this situation? Should I bother saying anything and just leave a subpar review on their pages? I want them to know we're upset with them and am curious to see if they'll compensate us since we have the roofer who is able to back us up.",legaladvice,Patio installers carelessly damaged roof shingles.

I have a basic legal question or two about an ongoing debt collection case in the small claims court. This was brought by a bank that granted a signature loan to me as part of a work/study program. The loan was granted along with other discussion and verbal agreement which led we the participants to believe the loan would ultimately be paid by a 3rd party (government agency).

The third party aspect of the case , and my presentation, caused the judge to have enough doubt to dismiss the plaintiff's previous motion for summary judgement. Now, trial is just days away.

My primary legal question with this case is regarding the initial complain and subsequent filing made by the plaintiff after they lost their bid for summary judgement. The initial complaint was essentially a copy of a standard loan agreement. It allegedly shows a signature by me, made via an e-sign. The second filing made by plaintiff after losing their motion is a clear move to try to bolster their case, but I believe it shows deception on the face. The second document includes the same or similar pages from first, with some addition ""esignature"" text at top. Beyond that there is only one distinct difference. A conveniently placed disclaimer of sorts that states the plaintiffs knowledge of the government agency that ""may"" pay off the loan. Of course, then goes on to say if they don't pay, I'm responsible, and so on.

There is more to this case, and the ""meat"" of it is the 3rd party and the teaching program which I participated in. However, the plaintiff (the bank) has been trying to pretend that none of those facts exists, and this was some sort of simple loan I just walked in and obtained - when my credit was and is very low and my home was in foreclosure at that time. Clearly the loan was granted at the time based exclusively on my enrollment in the programs.

I know the there are grey areas in this case, and so I'm trying to focus on what , if anything , is solid in the end. From a simple legal standpoint , what can be said about this activity of the plaintiff filing one agreement in the initial complaint, and then filing a ""revised"" agreement clearly more suited to their case after the fact? To me, there is that, and also the proof if any of my actual signature. Two agreements (when there can only be one), and the e-signature component come to mind, as we were all huddled in a group meeting at 6am that day trying to understand what we were signing up for.

Hello.

We are debating about whether it’s worth it to take our former property manager to small claims court.

My girlfriend and I moved out of our apartment at the end of June. Our property manager told us explicitly that the next tenant coming into the place we were leaving behind had a very loose and casual timeline. He told us that we could take the 1st of July, even into the 2nd of July to leisurely get our stuff out and move at a comfortable pace.

 We thanked him for his generosity, and we confirmed with him multiple times that he was alright with us moving on the day of the 1st, rather than June 30th, because I was working a 12 hour shift on June 30th, and if he really wanted us to be out by then, we would have needed to find another plan. 

But lo and behold, he told us it was alright to take some extra time, which we thanked him for, because it meant that I didn’t need to get a shift covered and lose out on pay. We made this explicitly clear and got an enthusiastic affirmative response that we thought we could be confident in.

Cut to June 30th, he called us and told us that he had carpet cleaners and painters coming on the afternoon of the 1st. Meaning he was already demonstrating that he knew we wouldn’t be done moving by the 30th. We asked him, “how are they going to clean the carpets when we’ve told you that our large furniture and belongings will still not be out of the apartment at that point in the afternoon? We told you that we planned to be gone by the evening of the 1st at the earliest, if not on the 2nd, which you have agreed to and  allowed us to do. How are they going to clean the carpets?” To which he replies, “it will be fine, they’ll just *lift everything up.*” Once again, this response confirmed that he was aware that we were taking extra time that he had granted. Otherwise, he would have told us at that point that we needed to be out earlier.

We were confused, but because he seemed to think it isn’t an issue, we proceeded with the plan that all parties had consented to. 

Cut to the afternoon of the 1st, a carpet cleaner arrived, took one look at our remaining belongings and furniture in the apartment, and told us he (obviously) couldn’t clean the carpets until everything was out. He called his boss to reschedule, after we told him that we would be gone by the afternoon of the 2nd (which, again, we were given permission to do by the property manager).

A few hours later, the property manager called up my girlfriend and verbally berated her into a state of tears. He raised his voice at her and told her that we should have already been out, and that we would need to pay for the carpet cleaners and the painters because of the reschedule.

We marched directly next door to our landlords house, thinking we could supersede our disorganized, and abusive property manager. The landlords were indifferent, having not even been aware of the situation, and having left the care, maintenance, and management of the property entirely to the incompetent property manager.

 As an aside, we can back up our claims of his incompetence with documentation. There were multiple points where he didn’t take care of infestations and pests. He would tell us that he would get certain things fixed or updated and he would just disappear or drop out of contact. There was maintenance on the property that was incomplete before we moved in, and remains unfinished since we’ve been gone. There was one point where our hot water boiler broke, and it took calling him every day to report it for a week until he finally replaced it. This was in February, where the weather in our area was approximately 10 degrees F or lower at night. When we confronted him about these things, he raised his voice at us and dismissed our concerns, as was his custom. This man answers his phone 10% of the time. This man doesn’t have an email address even though he somehow “manages” many properties in our city. I don’t know how he does it. This man’s office looks like a bomb went off. His assistant quit in anger because of his well known lack of organization. When I say he is getting senile, it isn’t an insult; it’s a clearly visible observation.

Essentially, our landlords told us that they didn’t know anything about the situation (once again, because of the property manager’s universal lack of communication) and couldn’t help us, short of commenting that “they didn’t want to pay for the cleaners and painters twice.” They told us they would call the property manager and ask for his side of the story. We told them about the permission for us to move out by the 2nd that was given to us by he property manager, and they told us that he didn’t communicate this to them.

So we are now in a situation where the property manager’s negligence and lack of organization has made it so that he has no record of the agreement or permission that he granted to us, and because of that, it’s our word against his.

He hasn’t told us if there are any other deductions he is planning to take from our security deposit. 

Our security deposit is worth $850. 

He hasn’t told us the dollar amount that the painters and carpet cleaners would have cost. 

We are wondering if it is worth contesting the charges for the painters and carpet cleaners due to the negligence on his behalf in the situation.

This man is unreachable and isn’t communicating with us about the money, whatever the situation might be.

We left the apartment in pristine condition without any additional damage to the extensive damage that was already present before we moved in. We were excellent tenants who received zero complaints in the two years that we lived there, with our landlords living next door. We were not late on rent once.

If there is any amount of money that he owes us, contesting these charges or not, money deducted from the security deposit or not, we have no idea.

He’s not answering my calls to his cell phone or returning my messages. 

His office number won’t pick up.

It is now late august. 

Is there a legal framework that dictates how long after someone moves out that the deposit needs to be taken care of?

At this point, it feels like he’s either intending to keep all of our money without explaining himself, or that he owes us money and is just running off with it.

Where’s our money?

Hi everyone, my great aunt recently passed away and my family is having quite a difficult time dealing with her property (house and personal items) due to my aunt’s boyfriend. She was unable to write up a will because she got sick extremely ill, but verbally vocalized to us what she wanted done with her larger assets. The boyfriend has been living with her in the house she owned for many years (no more than 10 but I’m unsure of the exact number of years) and is still residing there. He is attempting to claim ownership of everything my aunt had, from her house to her animals, even though they were not married, he is not listed as her next of kin on any paperwork, and my great aunt’s child, mother, and sister are all still alive and well, living 30 minutes from the property. His name is not on the mortgage, deed, or the utilities, and the HOA has never been informed of his residency at the property. From my knowledge, the HOA requires a separate application for everyone living on any premises within the subdivision. 

This may or may not be relevant so I’ll add it just in case: a few days ago, 4 of my family members and myself went over to start going through my great aunt’s things. The place was trashed, the animals weren’t being taken care of, and the boyfriend was smoking pot in the house with a guy the whole time we were there. We also could not locate a few items of value, such as her phone, wallet, and jewelry that she wore often, and the boyfriend said they must still be at the hospital (where she died). He made some rude comments to us and a screaming match ensued, but there were no physical altercations. We left with what we could fit in our vehicles and told the boyfriend we would be back to get whatever was left. 
Yesterday, we found out that the hospital released all her personal items she had with her to the boyfriend, even though they are not married and he is not listed as her next of kin, her mother (my great grandmother) is. My great grandmother was not notified of this or asked if this was okay. She only found out because the boyfriend lied about the location of the items, and she called the hospital to see if she could come pick up my great aunt’s things. The boyfriend refuses to give them to my great grandmother. 
Today, my great grandmother, grandmother, and cousin went over to the house to get a few more things. The boyfriend let them inside, but then attempted to physically assault my great grandmother and called the police, saying they broke in. I’m unsure of all the details of what happened with the officer that arrived, but everyone walked away from the incident. 

So my questions are: how do we remove him from the property? Will my family have to pay for the utilities while he is residing there, or can we shut them off? Can we press charges if he further damages the property? If the HOA finds out the boyfriend has been there all these years, can my family be fined for a. failure to notify them all these years and/or b. the boyfriend never applying and being approved yet still residing on the property? Can we just notify the HOA of his living there and have them evict him? Can my great grandmother press charges for the attempted assault, even though the boyfriend was unsuccessful?

Situation: three siblings, Mary, Nancy and Mark are almost done splitting out assets left to them by their parents estate. Mary was appointed as POA and Executor of the Estate before their parents passed. Everything else has been divided and carried out minus their parent home. They each are entitled to 1/3 of the home, property surrounding home was purchased out by Mark as stated in will. Just after their mom passed away, Mary’s son moved into the vacant home as he was going through a divorce and needed a place to stay. We will call him John. Unfortunately in the last few years both Mary and John have become serious alcoholics. John moved into the house prematurely as the plan was he was going to purchase all the siblings out and buy the home. However, his credit is terrible and cannot get a mortgage in the couple times he has tried. He’s been living in home since early 2018. Because it was such a quick ask to let him live there before purchasing, there was no rental agreement put into place. A verbal agreement of $600 a month paid to his mom Mary as they estimated what a mortgage payment would look like for him. Fast forward to today…. John has taken horrible care of home basically destroying the inside, and has junk and beer cans litering the outside of the home (house is located in a very rural area). Mark and Nancy are sick of this run around and want to be done with this entire thing. They talk to Mary, Mary says she took care of their dying mother and she isn’t going to force her son out of the home or do anything other than what is currently being done. BTW, John is very behind on his $600 rent payments. The level of alcoholism in both John and Mary is almost non functional. But since Mary is refusing to do anything toward her son the other siblings are left just to watch this entire thing go to crap. It is their understanding they cannot do anything without Mary being on board. They cannot evict John since he has school aged children living with him. There is no lease so they cannot say he’s breaking the lease… the only advice they have been given is to have the 2 siblings share their part of the home to a 3rd party and that owner can come in and force Mark out or to get mortgage since they would be a majority owner…. Mark said he could just walk away from the whole thing and just say he’s never going to see anything from the house (he also lives next door and has to see the home decorate daily) but Nancy needs her share of the proceeds from the house and wants it acted out now as it has gone on long enough….

I have records from school and doctors that can prove consistency with the abuse, along with a social services case that was open when I was a child. Immediately after, I was homeless, joined the military, where I met my ex. Throughout our marriage, I struggled with my mental health… I mean, who goes through shit like this and comes out completely unscathed? Anyway, we had two kids and my ex would get pissed every time I sought help. It got so bad that he would scream and yell at me until I broke down and locked myself somewhere to get away from him. He’s even recorded the aftermath and would narrate “see, I’m not even doing anything to her and she’s acting this way.” He also called my current boyfriend to tell him I’m diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (FYI - my ex initiated the divorce, not me so it was odd he was upset I had a boyfriend even though he was the one leaving me for another woman).

Sure, that’s all hearsay, but here’s my problem:

He has nothing on me besides my mental health. Otherwise, since our separation and divorce, our children have flourished, even when he didn’t come around for 6 months (he worked 5 minutes from the kids!) 

He is claiming I cut myself all the time - I have not since before my children were born. Could I have a doctor or someone physically check my body and verify that I am not hurting myself? Could they even go as far to say how old a scar would be? (I have marks from when I was a child).

He is claiming I do drugs - I use legal CBD and had a therapist who encouraged me to do so. Could I volunteer to be drug tested?

He is also using my mental health diagnosis to prove that I am unable to care for my kids. My therapist can’t testify as she is out of state but can write a letter. Other than the actual diagnosis, I have never done anything to hurt my children or neglect them. 

My lawyer is concerned because the judge is heavily republican and loves his service members but my ex served much longer than I did and his lawyer is also a veteran. Lawyer says that he believes they’ll try to subpoena my mental health records and since psychotic disorders are still stigmatized, he’s worried about how that will play out. Sure, we have plenty of shit my ex actually did (like medical neglect of the kids, having them sleep on the floor, and not seeing them for over a year) but he does not have a mental health record.

My friends recommended me subreddit, and I hope that I will find some advice here. The issue is that my business partners didn’t pay for the last invoice I’ve sent to them for 3 months already. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our written agreement allows them to postpone the payment for 30 days in case of force majeure circumstances. They didn’t pay me for more than 90 days, and they always explain that their sales are lower than expected due to the pandemic. That’s why they cannot pay me. My business is also affected by the pandemic. We couldn’t work online, unlike many other companies, during the lockdown. But all this stuff happened several months ago, and now life is coming back to normal. So, I understand that they might have faced specific problems with sales. Perhaps everyone has encountered a similar situation. That’s why we have a post lockdown financial crisis. I also understand that they need to pay wages to their employees. But I also have people working for me, and I don’t want to cut their salaries, bonuses, or even fire someone because I have no money to pay. I have some other clients, but they never order from us that much, as does this specific client. So, obviously, I don’t wanna lose a big fish like this one.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, all their explanation I hear on the phone. So, our client never replies to our emails. So, I don’t think that phone calls they make can work in court if we decide to sue them. We asked them several times to reply in written form to our request or confirm everything they have mentioned on the phone via email. But it seems like they just ignore all our requests.

I’ve looked for some information online and tried to check some laws. I also find some information about reasonable late payment fees. But with the lack of knowledge in this field, I’m getting even more confused. I wonder if I can use everything that is written there somehow. Besides, is it even possible to see the client and save him as a loyal customer?

My 10-year-old is returning to school for the first time since March 2020. We elected to enroll him in virtual school for the 2020-2021 school year. [EDIT RIGHT HERE - virtual was last year. This year is 2021-2022 school year.] When researching his assigned teacher for this new year in-school, we've discovered she has multiple public posts on social media claiming that the covid vaccine is a lie, it kills people, etc.; that she is against masks and children need to be freed from wearing masks; and, that she is card-carrying, medically exempt from wearing a mask (shared in the context of being refused service at a local establishment).

Upon learning this publicly-available information shared by the teacher, I emailed the principal and requested that he be moved to a different class before the start of the school year. The principal has refused, saying that our request amounts to medical discrimination against that teacher. Masks and vaccinations are not required in this district.

Is it, in fact, medical discrimination to ask for my child to be moved to a different room if I have concerns that a teacher will not adequately protect them during this pandemic? How will I know if she is being safe, will she stay home if she feels ill? Monitor her temperature daily? Provide periodic negative tests? Am I even allowed to ask these questions of her (I do think it's important to emphasize that she has shared this information freely and publicly on social media). I will continue to push for what I think is best for my child, but now that the discrimination word has been used, I need to tread very lightly.

EDIT2: Thank you all for the replies. I do not intend to discuss the pros and cons of vaccines and masks, whether I am scared or brave, or any other opinions on the validity or foolishness of my family's response to the pandemic.

Back story, my grandfather (72) has a close friend that known each other for a very long time. My grandfather got his taxes screwed up several years ago and to keep his property from being taken he and two other friends created a for profit corporation  and put his property in the corporation amd they all own a 1/3 of the Corp. Well one of the friends sold his share to the other friend. So the friend now owns 2/3 and my grandfather own 1/3. Well fast forward a year or so. My grandfather started to realize his age and that he wasn't as he was, his short term memory was getting worst, and talked to his friend about making him his power of attorney. As far as I know they never got around to filling out the paperwork. My grandfather is also a horder. Well about 2 months ago my grandfather fell and broke his neck and was put I the hospital temporarily. My grandfathers friend was given medical power of attorney for my grandfather while he was still lucid. Once that happened the friend started pushing that he had dementia, hard. 
Little while later the friend accused me of stealing from my grandfather and trespassed me from his property. My grandfathers property is pretty large and I had a trailer I was living in on it also had various vehicles and other stuff stored on the property. I have not been able to get access to any of it. Then right away the friend started cleaning up my grandfathers property (under pressure from the city) 
My grandfather was recently about two weeks ago released from the hospital to live with another friend while he has his medical brace on. It has been a fight for me to see and talk to my grandfather. His friend has taken control of my grandfathers medical stuff, his finances, and his property. Friend claims he's got full power of attorney. (When and how I have no idea) Has signed papers stating it. Not notarized as far as I know.  Friend also got my grandfather on medication for dementia and other prescribed by a Dr. That isn't his Dr. Friend has removed Me from any control, say so and overseeing what so ever that  i once had.

Arkansas here.

I recently had a firearm stolen from me. I first discovered that my firearm was missing about 11 days ago and, to the best of my knowledge from what I was able to piece together, had gone missing about a week prior. I have been attempting the past week to recover this firearm on my own.

I had been trying to help 2 friends who were homeless get back on their feet. For the purpose of this post, I will call them ""A"" and ""C"".

""C"" had been staying with me about a month as of Wednesday, August 11th. About 4 weeks ago, 3 weeks prior to my finding out my gun was missing, ""C"" had asked if ""B"" could hang out for the night. I allowed this because I felt ""C"" was getting cabin fever and feeling cooped up (I do live out in the boonies). 

A few days later, ""C"" asked if ""A"" could stay the night (which I again allowed). But, the next day, after I had brought ""B"" and ""C"" back ""to town"", ""A"" wound up losing the place he was staying. ""A"" asked if he could stay with me for a couple of weeks, as he had a job which provided housing lined up to start 2 weeks later. Again, I allowed this.

On the day that ""A"" and ""C"" were supposed to leave for the above mentioned job (""A"" had got a job for ""C"" as well), I went to gather up my guns, as I had promised ""A"" and ""C"" that we would shoot; this would be the last chance to do so before they left. As I was gathering my guns to shoot, I realized that one was missing.

I began searching and came to the conclusion that it had been stolen.

I was able to find a picture on social media of ""B"" posing with my missing gun (although this picture could have been taken in my home). 

I also found a picture on ""A""'s phone, showing someone holding said gun in a setting that was definitely not my home (the picture was of a hand holding the gun. It was indoors and there was a light fixture in the background which I do not have in my home. There was no face in this picture. When I found this picture, ""A"" and ""C"" said that on the first night after I had taken the 2 of them into town, ""B"" had gotten a ride to my place to visit them, but noone was home (I do work nights). ""A"" also said ""B"" had found them afterwards at the hotel they were staying at, and had used ""A""'s phone to take this picture.

""C"", was an acquaintance prior to all of this. I thought him to be somewhat trustworthy and had just been dealt a bad hand. During the course of staying with me, ""C"" had proved himself untrustworthy (he had used some of my put-away personal items without my permission, along with other unsavory habits. He had had a deadline to make other living arrangements which would have expired shortly after the day he and ""A"" left for their job [the first arranged job fell through, but they had landed another, similar job and needed to report to it rather quickly, which is why his deadline was past it]). ""C"" had also been accused of stealing items in the past, including a firearm (information that I didn't find out until he had been staying with me for a while), but he swore that he had never stolen any of the items of which he had been accused. I had also witnessed him clearing up a misunderstanding among some of his other friends where he had been accused of stealing items, but then it was discovered that it was actually someone else who had set it up to look like ""C"" had done it 

""B"" I don't know much about other than his name.

""A"" again, I did not know anything about him when I agreed to let him stay with me. However, during the course of him staying with me, I had seen no evidence of him doing anything to disrespect or take advantage of me, nor did I witness him doing anything that I would call shady.

I have also found out that all 3 of these people tend to run with unsavory crowds.

As I was taking ""A"" and ""C"" to their job, we had an interaction with the local police, and ""C"" was arrested on outstanding warrants, which I was unaware he had (failure to appear, I believe).

I have sent both ""A"" and ""B"" (""C"" was in jail and without a phone) explaining that I wasn't interested in who took my gun, or how it happened, that I wasn't interested in anyone trying to defend themselves or pointing fingers at anyone else; That I was only interested in the recovery of my firearm.  Both of them continue trying to point the finger at each other. ""A"" was calm, almost jovial in his response. 

""B"" called me got rather upset at the situation, claiming he had already spent time in jail for a similar situation in which he was innocent. In this call he:
1. Claimed he was being set up as a scapegoat in this.
2. Swore it wasn't him.
3. Offered to compensate me for my firearm.
4. Begged me not to press charges on him
5. Made vague threats about knowing where I live.

I did tell ""B"" that I wouldn't press charges (knowing that naming him in a police report was not the same as me pressing charges).

My family go-to guy for legal matters (a man well versed in the intricacies of law, but is not a lawyer) has advised I go to the state police, file a report naming ""B"" as the primary person of interest. He said with the picture I have of him posing with my gun and with the things he said in the phone call, that I should name him and him alone; that the state police would go to him and question, maybe even search him and his place, and if they don't find the gun, he will have no further unpleasantness happen to him.

I am prepared to go to the state police, but I am concerned that ""B"" was set up in this and that naming him in the report would be doing him wrong.

A few months ago, the management company changed and we made multiple calls to ensure our lease would still be in tact and tranfered over properly. We even payed rent a few times with the new management company during our first lease term.

Late July came around and we called in after a few friends moved in and had issues with their renewed leases. After a few calls, the new management company revealed that the renewed leases never properly transfered over. We sent our lease again, got a new move in date, and were reassigned to a new apartment. 

Yesterday, we officially moved in. We paid our first month of rent and got our keys. Inside the apartment, we found a few items in the apartment, but figured that an old tenant hadn't wanted to move them out, so we began to move in. Today, though, two past residents showed up at our door incredibly confused as to why we were in their apartment. We've talked it out for the night, but we plan on going to the apartment complex front desk together tomorrow morning to make sure management fixes the issue. 

The other pair of roommates' parents had been in the apartment only a week ago and they have an old lease. I'm not entirely sure on the details they have with management. I believe the apartment complex is obligated to honor both of our leases and still give us each an apartment. Nonetheless, which one of us would  be able to legally stay in the apartment? We all know that this fault all lies with the apartment complex, so is there anything we can all do to ensure none of us get messed over? And is there anything we can demand from the complex aside from a proper set-up for both of our parties, such as compensation for moving costs or rental reduction for the inconvenience of it all? 

As a college student and new renter, any advice would be appreciated!! Either in what legal rights we have or about what we can say when we walk up to the leasing office tomorrow.

After having been issued the summons, I provided documentation of my application for rental assistance as per [Senate Bill 278.](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/SB278/House%20Amendments%20to%20Introduced), which requires the landlord to immediately cease all eviction actions for 60 days.

The particularly relevant part of the law reads as follows:

&gt; (b) If the tenant provides the landlord or court with documentation of application for rental assistance as described in subsection (2) of this section at any time after the landlord commenced the action for possession and at or before the first appearance, at the first appearance the court shall, on its own motion, postpone the first appearance to a date not earlier than 60 days after the documentation was delivered.

On one hand, they are not allowed to proceed with eviction actions for 60 days, so it would seem that I do not need to attend the first appearance as it will be automatically postponed until the end of 60 days, since they cannot proceed with eviction actions until then. On the other hand, if I do not attend the court appearance, they automatically win the case, the consequences of which would be my eviction.

So: Do I have to attend the first appearance or not? Or will the court's postponement, happening on its own motion, go forward regardless of my attendance?

I know that showing up, just for the sake of it, is probably the safer bet - and I will if I can't get a clear answer to the contrary, and I plan to call the court to see if they can give me any information, but I thought I'd see if anyone here was familiar with Oregon law regarding this.

The incident wasn’t premeditated (I’m not sure if that matters). There’s a large rock on my campus that students have a history of spray painting on (It’s encouraged), and a can of spray paint was left at the rock. My friends started spray painting the rock and I sprayed the sign next to it really impulsively and I regret it a lot. I should note that the sign that I painted wasn’t a traffic sign, I think it was a university sign explaining the history of the spray paint rock. I was caught on camera doing it.

The police went to my friends dorm and showed him and his roommate the camera footage, and his roommate said it was me in the video. The police came to my house (after I moved off campus) to question me a month after it happened. I didn’t exactly confess but I didn’t deny it either. They asked for a written statement but my mom came outside to see what was going on so I asked them to leave and they did. The cop said it wasn’t a big deal but I might have to go to court and it could possibly be a misdemeanor.

My friends dad is a cop and she said to just confess to make their job easier (/!; maybe they’d go easier on me) so I called the officer back 2 times and left 2 messages a week later, and didn’t hear back from them for a month and a half. The officer said that it was because he doesn’t really check his work phone, so he gave me his cell phone number. He called me on his cell and requested to meet in person in 2 days.

Some additional information: 
- I’m black 

- The officer did not accuse me of underage drinking or anything else (I don’t think he has enough evidence to support that). 

- I’m being investigated by campus police specifically. Campus police tend to be more lenient (they don’t really press charges for underage drinking, they refer them to the university for alcohol education programs). I don’t know if I should expect facing vandalism charges in court, or if I should expect community service/repercussions from the university.  

- I want to reduce the risk of getting charged with a misdemeanor as much as possible. I could risk losing my financial aid or admission to doctorate programs I intend on applying to. Painting the sign was a really stupid mistake and I’ve been really anxious over the situation all summer.

- I can’t afford my own lawyer/ I need to keep my family out of this.

Should I request to talk to a lawyer? The cop seems nice and all my friends think that I should just confess and get things over with, but I don’t want to be naive about the possible repercussions. I also don’t want to drag things on longer than I need to. It seems like they’re being sporadic about following up with me. However, it also seems like they’re going out of their way to get information from me to build a case. It seemed like they were treating the case seriously when they came to my house to question me instead of coming to my dorm on campus/ handling it through the university.

Should I request a lawyer when I talk to the officer in a few days? I get the sense that overall, campus police try to not give students charges that will follow them for life. However, it does feel like they really want a written statement or confession (which only really seems necessary if they’re considering criminal charges).",legaladvice,Do I confess to the police?

Firstly, I'm not American - I'm Australian - but the people this concerns both are American. I myself am a minor, I'll be 16 in approximately one month, so do with that information what you will. I'll have to explain what happened before I can ask for advice so bare with my shitty story-telling.


I play a game called VRchat. If you don't know what it is it's pretty much a bunch of chat rooms you can physically walk around in using virtual reality, and it's for people who are 13+, but adults are more common. I have a friend who's 14, she's the victim in this story. I know her real name and state but I'm just going to be calling her ""K"" because I want to protect her identity. I join K and find her sitting with someone and I go ""Oh, who's your friend?"" (It's kind of Important to know that we're communicating with sign language at this point so you know how the friend communicates without speaking) She corrects me and signs ""*boy* friend"". I disapprove of minors doing online dating as a rule but I don't say anything because it's none of my business. Not yet. I ask how long they've been together because I've never met the guy in my life and the guy signs ""1 month"" and then corrects himself to ""2 months"" about a minute later. I move on and start talking to other friends that were in the room when I hear him talk, and he sounds pretty old. Not super old, and voices can be deceiving. I have a deep voice too, and I'm often confused for an adult when using a microphone so I'm not *too* concerned but I have to make sure. I ask how old he is and he doesn't answer, but stops speaking verbally again. I pester him for 5-10 minutes and after even trying to distract me by drawing a tic-tac-toe board he finally traces ""15"" in the air. This doesn't seem too bad, but I'm still put-off. About half an hour later he leaves and I'm talking to K when she tells me that he's not fifteen, he's TWENTY-FIVE. I immediately start telling her that that's not okay and she writes things back like ""But I like him"" and ""But I'm consenting to the relationship"" to which I obviously reply that it doesn't make a difference. I try to explain how dangerous it is and how he's manipulating her. I talked to her for 30-45 mins so I can't remember everything I said but I recorded the second half of the conversation. I convince her to tell me his state and I have his discord from his in-game bio at this point. No matter what I say she won't accept that he's bad but I know she knows it's wrong because A. She didn't just leave in the middle of our conversation. B. She hesitated before telling me his age and C. When I told her to tell one of her teachers IRL she said no. At one point she asked ""What if I wait until i'm 18?"" Which me and my friend shut down immediately. In the end me and 2 friends have convinced her that she needs to be wary but I really don't think she'll break up with him. I'm not letting this be a choice, there's no future in which I'm allowing this to continue. I have video of us talking about him being 11 years older than her and I made sure I had her confirm his user name on camera (Which she initially said it wasn't but I told her I knew she was lying and she gave up) and I have his discord along with his age and state. I'm going to message him on discord and try to get him to  talk about the fact he's older than her in a non-confrontational way (Like just saying K told me his age and asking why he lied) I'm not even going to insinuate what he did was wrong. I want to get him to admit it in which case I'll report this to both Discord and VRchat because I know Discord takes paedophilia very seriously.

1. Is it okay not to disclose my medical history of surgery? (This was a one-time surgery and I am fully recovered now. I do not have any side effects from the surgery, nor I am under any medication and at the moment I do not have any prevailing medical issues.)

I am so, so sorry if I sound emotionally mad while typing this. My girlfriend has just told me a story that pissed me off more than anything else I have ever heard in my entire life and as I am typing this letter I am crying thinking about her and the feelings she must have felt.

At 5 years old. 5 FREAKING YEARS OLD. Her uncle told her he had a surprise for her and said to close her eyes. He put her hand over his pen** and made her stroke it till he finished for a year. Then one day he put a pistol to her head and said he would kill her mom, dad, siblings and everything. And told her to take off her clothes and started rubbing against her. He took “toys” and made her use them and penetrated her. When she bled he ran away for a couple hours then came back for more. He didn’t stop this. He even took her virginity. Until she was 11. Not because he wanted to but because he got caught by the cops for a different crime and deported to Mexico. She doesn’t trust any man even her own father even though he is good besides me. 

   Now in Mexico he lives in Cancun in an apartment with a wife, good job, cars, and a good FREAKING LIFE. This is 6 years later. She told her mom but when she did her mom got terrible terrible anxiety and now she hasn’t helped at all besides being worried. She won’t tell the rest of her family because they will kill the uncle for sure she said. I have never been more ashamed of what a man can do and I cannot write anymore. She said that she does not hate him but does not like him because she said when she recently saw him he had shame in his eyes and said sorry. I cannot believe this.

I subleased a unit due to past criminal history. My felonies are 12 years old. While living at this property I graduated college and paid rent early/on time for 10 months.

Upon moving into the property I personally picked up the keys from the property manager. I saw him on property many times. My car is registered at that address and my Texas ID has that address. In June I fell behind on rent and sought rental assistance but was ultimately denied because the lease was not in my name. I have email conversations between myself and the manager regarding the rental assistance and unpaid rent. They sent me a notice to vacate for none payment.

Towards the end of July, he went on vacation. His replacement notified the lease holder regarding the unpaid rent. I attempted to meet with the leaseholder, he refused. Instead, upon managers return, the leaseholder picked up a key to my apartment from him and gave it to two of his friends. Those two people entered to my apartment without my consent or permission and removed my laptop and personal paperwork. At this time, I tested positive for Covid and was at another location asleep. I received a notification from my security camera that there was motion inside my apartment. The camera recorded these two people in the act of stealing my laptop and I promptly called 911. 

I met the police at my apartment and they documented the incident. I left and went to another location to rest and recover. Early the next morning I checked the status of my security cameras and they were offline. I immediately went to the apartment only to find these two individuals had returned and spent quite some time ransacking my apartment. They took a shower, left their dirty clothes, cooked my food and made off with over 10k worth of my belongings. I called the police again and documented the incident. 

It was at this point, the manager labeled me as a trespasser and demanded I move out of the property by the end of that day. He assured me that he would call the police on me. They issued another notice to vacate for illegally subleasing. I have documentation of all of this including emails, police reports, and documents from management.

**Background:** I signed a 12 month lease with an apartment complex (managed by a large company) in Jan. 2021. I am closing on a house in October and went ahead and submitted my 60 day notice per my lease's early termination (i.e., lease buy out) conditions. The conditions clearly state the fees I have to pay: relet fee and payback of any concessions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:** The management office is claiming that I will also forfeit my security deposit by terminating my lease early.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dispute:** I've read all 50 pages of the lease, and no where does it state that I voluntarily forfeit the security deposit if I terminate the lease early. And from what I can tell, Georgia state law doesn't have any statutes for the same either. 

I've asked the management office to show me where in the lease that it says I forfeit the deposit if I terminate the lease early. They have yet to provide proof and this dispute has been ongoing for 2 weeks since my initial notice. I have reached back out to them several times during this 2 week period to firm things up, and they keep saying they'll call me back, but they never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Request for advice:** My understanding of O.C.G.A. 44-7-33 states that security deposits illegally withheld result in a 3x penalty plus legal fees.

1. Is my understanding of O.C.G.A 44-7-33 correct?
2. If so, do I just let them keep the security deposit now, then take them to small claims court later? If not, then what do you suggest?
3. What about all of the other people that this company has potentially screwed over? I'm sure that many others have terminated their lease early and not contested these conditions to the degree that I have. If possible, I'd like to give back to them if we can prove the company has been illegally retaining the security deposits for others as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I had verbally expressed several times during manager meetings that we can't open this facility, that someone will be hurt due to the owner's negligence in order to make it as cheap as possible and maximize potential profits. The owner also made it a point to open in the middle of a heat wave, offering on-site staff no place to sit that was shaded, no way to close the facility down to take a restroom break or lunch break, despite telling him that we needed to resolve this before opening.

&amp;#x200B;

The owner ignored my pleas, opened the facility and I took action by contacting the local engineering department and OSHA early in the day. By mid day my employer found out, asked me about it and then promptly deleted my work email, changed all logins I had access to within the company and has been radio silent. As far as I know I am fired but have not had verbal or written confirmation.

I am also aware and have proof that this employer has committed illegal acts within the department of labor laws, does not have employees file I-9s. This employer has a board of directors as it is a non-profit but has said verbally multiple times that he does not consult the board to make decisions that are required by law, such as hiring and raises. The employer gets away with this because the other 3 board members are family members and their best friends. I am also suspicious of continuous raises for the owner not being appropriate and only being done due to the board being family and friends.

This is a small city in Northern Wisconsin with a small hospital. His doctor recommended that we take him to the hospital and that he be admitted and monitored overnight. We took him across the street to the emergency room where he was taken in.

Fast forward, we are at the hospital and after his initial check up and after he had been given fluid we were not told he could go home, instead we were told that ""there are no available hospital beds in Wisconsin."" He was in the emergency room but the didn't have any beds available and we were told they couldn't transfer him to any hospital in the state of Wisconsin. When pressed on this we were told that the had to transfer somebody earlier that day to LaCrosse Wisconsin which is over 3 hours (read very far) away. That of course was not a good option either given the burden this would have put on our family as well.

Had we not have been told that grandpa would have spent the night in the hospital and been admitted. Instead, the last 2 days have been hell. We've been on edge not knowing what to do and monitoring him closely making sure he's okay and doing alright. So far we've been okay and grandpa does appear to be doing better.

Concerningly, following the news it doesn't appear to reflect what the doctor said. The state of Wisconsin is reporting still about 84% full for hospitals in the state which would tell me that there should have been a bed available for grandpa. I'm deeply concerned with what the hospital told us and feel like they just didn't want to deal with him, especially since what they told us felt like an excuse to go against the advice of his PCP, who recommended he be admitted and watched overnight.

How may I go about investigating that there in fact were no beds available for grandpa? Is this a big deal, or something relatively common in hospitals? If there were beds available for grandpa what remedy would he have available to him? I'm afraid he was not admitted because of his disability and because of his age. Are hospital beds in fact not available to individuals in his situation when hospital bed capacity at the state level is 84%?

We've reached out to media that has been unable to get an answer from the hospital regarding capacity and have also recently notified our county ADRC.

I fell on some hard times during 2020 and I’m just now getting my feet under me. My car was repossessed on August 11, and I was able to pay off the outstanding balance and get it reinstated on August 13. 

I finance through Kia Motor Finance, and my car was repossessed by Par North America, who took my car to an impound lot called Dash Recovery. 

I was told that I need to call Dash Recovery to set up a time to pick up my car. They are only open 3 hours a day, 3 days a week, and there is one employee running the whole lot. That is the only info I have on the place, it was included in the voicemail greeting. So naturally, nobody has been picking up the phone or returning my voicemails or emails. I’ve called every day they are open, multiple times a day, and left one voicemail a day. I’ve also sent 3 emails. 

Neither Kia nor Par North America have the address for Dash Recovery, and they don’t show up on Google. Their HQ in Corpus Christi does, but not the lot in my city where my car is. Neither company is able to contact the lot either. 

I was told I need to “just keep calling until someone answers”. This isn’t working, it has been 6 days since it was reinstated, and 9 days since it was repossessed. I was told I have 10 days guaranteed to get my car back before it’s taken to auction, potentially. 

My car is fully legally mine, but nobody can tell me where it is or how to get it back.

In the meantime, Defense Counsel has stated they intend to appeal the Court's ruling. Defense Counsel has spent the last 2 years deliberately causing delay, obstructing the onset of Discovery, destroying evidence, amongst other misconduct.

I was advised to not file any pleadings, regardless of their validity, importance, the fact that there are deadlines, by the pro bono legal help center, who apparently has been ordered to provide me with pro bono representation, who told me that a law firm had reached out to the judge during a hearing (there were no other people in the zoom hearing room at the last conference, but there were other people in the zoom hearing room before that several months ago), and asked the judge if they could represent me pro bono. But pro bono legal help office then said that there was ""a conflict"", and I was going on a list. I was clearly advised not to file the motion I had been working on for 4 weeks, repetitively using the word ""cooperative"" to describe potential future conversations with pro bono representation about me, because of the problems that would be caused by ""cross-filing"". They see the motions as critical of them personally, for example they advised me ""just wait"" for the 2 years the onset to Discovery; not something I ever bring up directly in the motion out of matter of course courtesy.

Defense Counsel is putting on a show that they dispute the claim, but it's extremely obviously hollow. Defendants do not dispute the material facts.

I live in North Carolina. This transaction was completed (and all contracts signed on this date) on 7/31/21. Because of the distance I had worked the numbers out and had them submit my application for financing before I went up there. They said I was able to get the 2.9% interest rate that Honda Financial offers. My credit score came back to them as 764 (all of my credit apps estimate 770), and they were saying being over 700 I was golden. I’m 29 just to give you an idea of my credit history in terms of years. 

The contract itself outlining the purchase numbers and financing information has a box on it that says “if checked this is applicable”. It’s a box that says “Limited Right to Cancel”. Box is not checked off, and at the initial lines it says N/A. However there was a form I signed that is titled “Conditional Limited Right to Cancel”. This form states basically if the dealership has an issue with selling the loan to a 3rd party, that they have 10 days from the date the contract is signed to notify me and then it goes on about returning the vehicle etc. 

I get a letter from them today - 8/19, but it’s dated for 8/12. Definitely past the 10 days from 7/31. It’s similar to the type of letter you get from a credit card company where they say they regret to inform you that they weren’t able to offer whatever, etc. again states this thing about not being able to sell it to a 3rd party on terms they agree upon. But all it says is if I have questions I can call to talk to the finance guy there, that I’ll get a letter giving more detail on why, that what was reported from the credit bureaus did not impact this decision, and that the lender should also contact me. Doesn’t mention anything about returning the vehicle. 

I checked my Honda Financial account. Still shows the loan, everything. I looked at the customer copy of the contract that they have on there, and it only shows the papers where “if checked this is applicable” is shown with no check or signature under it. The loan shows on my credit report now. 

All things set aside…they are outside of their 10 days correct? Why would they send me a letter dated more than 10 days beyond the contract date? I’m still baffled that I got the letter at all. I put down $4600, didn’t finance the taxes because there was a discrepancy on how much it’s supposed to be due to different laws in NC. Out the door was roughly $27,400, financed $21,800. So this wasn’t one of those approvals where they got me in by the skin of my teeth taking the smallest down payment possible. 

It’s also worth noting that I don’t have major debt. My old car loan was in my name only. I have at minimum $20k in credit across all of my cards, and I use less than 15% utilization. 

I’m just at a loss and panicking. I emailed the girl I worked with about it and I plan to call them as well as Honda financial.

I made eye contact but didn't say or do anything until he walked away and returned to his car. After waiting a bit my bf felt safe to go inside to work but the guy sprints out of his car again and backs my bf into a corner and starts screaming in his face, not making any sense, and when someone opened the door to help the guy turned on them and went ballistic. I don't think he actually put his hands on anyone. 

I had gotten out of my car at this point to watch if I should call 911 but he walked back to his car again. I returned to my car hoping he wouldn't notice me, and suddenly he takes off and goes all the way to the other end of the parking lot, lines up with my driver door, and floors it while I'm just staring in disbelief thinking my life is over. I wasn't seriously injured and managed to get out of the car and run inside and call the police. 

I recounted every step of what happened multiple times to multiple people but on the police report it basically just says the guy was disturbing the peace and got into a minor car accident because his brakes were slightly messed up. They let him go home even though he was acting totally insane the entire time he was with the cops including in the emergency room. He lives like 200 yards away from our house and the place where it happened. We feel extremely unsafe and I can't sleep at all. I never said I wanted to press charges at the time because I was too freaked out to even think of that and they never asked. They also never asked the store about security footage, which I have confirmed that they have everything on tape. I've tried calling the police station at the number on the card they handed me and no one has answered or responded to my message.

I have no idea how literally any of this works or where to even begin but I just know someone tried to kill me and now he's free and is basically right next door. Do I need to contact an attorney?

I work in corporate and I've been with this company for about 6 months after spending almost 8 years at my previous company until COVID cutbacks.  Right after I was hired I started noticing some unappealing traits of my manager and then we went through a lot of changes that led me to think about leaving.  

Long story short, I contracted COVID in late July and I was still working from home and continued to do so.  He reached out and asked if things were good and I told him I felt pretty bad but I would continue working as I could and he said that was fine but I should take care of myself when needed and could take off (which I didn't need permission as we don't have a specific PTO policy but it was good for him to reiterate it).  Two days later I decided to take the rest of the week (which was just a day and a half) off to rest as I got over the worst of it.  I checked my teams messages that weekend and he had sent a snarky message complaining that I had taken off and didn't ask him directly (that's never been the process either, we just get our work covered and put it on his calendar, I did both).  I replied back stating that it was never our process and he constantly changes his expectations so it's impossible to keep up with - frustrated but I don't deal with that kind of shit, keep in mind you should always feel empowered to speak your mind.  He replied back that we would deal with it later and on Monday I went ahead and put my 2 weeks notice in which he accepted. 

That week I got a call from our healthcare partner asking me when I would be returning to work, I was naturally confused and said that I was already back and she stated that someone had put in a leave of absence on my behalf and I said no I had simply taken off a day and a half.  No issues.  This week, my last, I get a message from someone in HR asking me about my leave of absence.  Same thing, I said I did not take one and she stated that it was put in for me backdated to late July that I was taking 2 weeks off.  This is blatant bullshit.  Luckily there are breadcrumbs that get left by the systems if you will that prove I was working, as well as the teams messages from my manager and when I asked the team to cover my daily work etc etc.  I have compiled all that as proof.  

But what this ultimately means is that he KNOWS I was working, yet is lying to them to mess with my last paycheck.  I don't see it working, though the HR rep said she needed to reach back out to him to clarify and I told them my issue is that he is the one who put it in in the first place and he isn't being truthful clearly. 

What recourse do I have?  Even if it does not work the very fact he tried is enough for me to consider taking whatever action I could.  I've never in my life had something like this take place, would never want to even go through this nonsense, but I am pretty damn fired up about it....

In the letter, the landlord indicated there may be still additional charges related to damage.  So far, so good...

A few days later (after 21st day, but before I had deposited the refund check), the Landlord decided there would be additional charges for damages. But instead of sending a subsequent detailed invoice for the additional damages, they instead placed a Stop Payment on the deposit refund check so that I couldn't cash it.

Question:  Was it legal for them to invalidate the refund payment check? And if not, would it fall under the category of ""passing a bad check"" (since it was included with the letter detailing the charges there were withheld).

For example: If the detailed letter along with the deposit refund (in cash) was initially hand-delivered, could they come a few days later and just take back the envelop of cash before it was deposited into my bank account?  And if that would be a form of theft, how is it any different if they invalidate the check after it was ""delivered"" by posting via US Mail... especially when that was done after the 21-day deadline to return the deposit?

To be clear: I am *not* asking about their right to levy additional charges for damages discovered after the deposit had been refunded. This is about their right to unilaterally pull-back the security deposit refund as a retainer for damages after the deadline, rather than shifting over and directly invoicing me for the additional damages (and seeking collections, if needed).",legaladvice,Can landlord place Stop Payment on security deposit refund check after it was delivered to me via USPS mail?

I hurt myself during the move, so the final clean out I'll admit was not perfect: some dust bunnies, dirty windows, and hair in the shower remained, but all the holes were patched and painted, we even replaced the stove burner wells as requested in our lease instead of letting them do it for $15/burner.

Prior to moving out I heard nothing from the landlord company, not even confirmation that they'd received my notice. I had to call them in the last week to ask what they wanted me to do with the keys since our last day fell on a weekend.

We get the walk-through report (which is mostly pictures) the next business day and they complain that the place is dirty, which not a surprise, but also complain that the caulking on the toilet is bad (it's a 50 yo building and that toilet is at least 10+ years old, so... Not a shocker), the windows have mildew on the frame (again, not a shocker and endemic to the building since I spotted a work crew getting ready to replace the windows in the apartment below ours), and that the kitchen floor was damaged (which it was when our lease started).  They wanted me to sign off on the report without giving me any opportunity to explain or counter their claims.

My parents were landlords while I was growing up, so I'd fortunately A) taken pictures on move in and B) knew what ""normal wear and tear"" meant.  I didn't sign off and emailed a rebuttal with photo evidence.  

Cue 2.5 weeks of radio silence.  I started calling them on day 13 to determine if they were going to hold the deposit for the whole month or not.  After two messages and no response I got a bit pushy with them and said that they were falling out of compliance with state law by not providing me my deposit or a bill after 2 weeks.  That at least got me to the senior manager who said they had 30 days to respond but that she'd get me an answer and/or a check in 24 hrs -- sure enough, the next day I get a call that the check is ready and when I asked she confirmed that I was ""only billed for the cleaning"".

Like I said in the beginning, I knew the place would need a final sweep/mop/wipe down because it wasn't perfect when we left it.  I expected that there'd be some deduction from our deposit.  

Their cleaners claim that they spent 12 hours (at $30/hr = $360 total) cleaning an apartment that is less than 900sqft total.  They claimed they needed to use ""heavy duty chemicals"" to clean the kitchen... And I just don't believe that they could spend that much time cleaning the place.  I scrubbed every inch of that kitchen and bathroom (after hauling everything out of those rooms) once a month in preparation for the roach control guys. It never took more than 2.5 hours to clean.  The place has laminate flooring wall to wall so it's not like there was a carpet to clean.

I'm tempted to take this to small claims court because this feels shady.  Unfortunately my camera glitched and I didn't get good photos of the place as we left it, and they've locked me out of their website so I can't access their move out report photos, which like I said were of dust bunnies, hair in the shower, and hand grime near the door handle.  

I don't want all my deposit back, I know some cleaning had to be done, but I'm at a loss for how it took 12 hours to clean it.

I feel I might be being taken advantage of and while I’m not ready to pursue anything legally I want to know if there are actual red flags here or if I’m just overreacting as someone who does not know much about the legal standpoints of LTD.

Basically I was in a car accident last year that messed up one of legs pretty bad (but this does not involve any insurance directly related to the car accident). Short term disability ended mid April, my private LTD insurance kicked in after and approved up to June. I had a 2nd surgery in March on the leg and they easily approved recovery time (from mid April when my STD ended) and just told me to submit office notes if my disability continued past June.

My doctor did not allow me to even attempt weight bearing on my leg until June and even now I have considerable difficulty walking. And my doctor said the recovery time for my surgery is approximately 4-6 months, but it hasn’t been a complete 6 months yet. And I still cannot ambulate without a mobility aid.

Since June they have been telling me they did not receive my office notes. By the end of July I was finally able to clear up that issue when the doctors office sent the office notes to them immediately as a courtesy to ME because the disability insurance company did not pay the invoice they were sent in order to receive the office notes. My claim manager acknowledged this by email when he received the office notes and said they would pay the invoice after the fact. However I JUST received a letter saying my claim has been closed since mid-April and they have decided it should remain closed even after they received the most recent office notes. I have asked, and not been given a reason, why my claim has been closed nor was asked for any additional information at any point. 

I have asked multiple times in the past two months if there was anything things else they needed or anyone they needed me to contact. The office notes were the only thing they requested. They now said I must appeal and to submit as much other info from my doctor as possible. However, I sent exactly what they said, copied and pasted, to my doctors office and they are confused on what the LTD place wants from my doctor. But said they would have the doctor write a document with more detail on my condition throughout the last few months to send to them to see if that would help facilitate things. My claim agent has also said he has submitted my appeal, but I have no way to confirm or check on this yet. My doctor has also yet to send the document yet but confirmed it will be there by the end of next week.

I guess I could be wrong about the legal idea of it but I’m most certainly disabled, even if I have slightly more mobility now in June I could not survive without crutches and needed help doing daily task. Not to my occupation at the time of my disability involved standing/walking all day. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of and I have no idea what to do next as the LTD company keeps contact to an absolute minimum.

I have resorted to sending an email every time I contact my doctors office for more information. And have asked the doctors office to send me an email confirming they sent a document to the LTD company and asking the LTD company to inform me when they receive any documents. I figured this way I have some sort of proof about what was discussed. It’s been two months, I have bills to pay. They will not give me any information and regularly ignore most of my question, which are only ever answered, if at all, by email because they do not answer their phones or return calls after I leave voicemails.

I want to do what’s legally correct and I don’t want more than I’m owed, honestly I just want this settled. It’s a slap in the faces to be disabled for almost year when you only expected it to be a couple months at most, it’s an even bigger slap when they basically decide you’re not disabled enough to receive a benefit you paid for without telling you their reasoning or communicating effectively (to myself or my doctor).


Also it may not matter but the letter I received telling me the claim will remained closed has the name of an “claim manager” I have never spoken to and an extension to contact that comes back as invalid when I try to reach it. Seems odd to me but I’m already upset so that could just be a genuine mistake.",legaladvice,Is my LTD insurance provider doing something legally shady?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7tdps/is_my_ltd_insurance_provider_doing_something/

In Michigan as Title says. I've kind of been stressing about this for a while now and was hoping I could get some answers here. I started my first year as a teacher last year (rough year for it I know). I got certified literally a day before testing and certification sites started closing back in March 2019. Upon receiving my certification, the certification email instructed me to get my certification notarized and then give it to my school as they would need a copy. 

Heres where things get a little wonky. Because of COVID, I had no way to get it notarized. If I'm being completely honest, that was the busiest period of my life and I also didn't try that hard. Anyway, I got hired in at my school. For whatever reason, the school never actually requested a copy of my teaching certificate (also most likely as a result of COVID as many of my fellow teachers at the time were unable to take the requisite certification exam and the need for it may have been suspended at that time). Well, it never came up and hasn't since so it slipped my mind pretty fast. First year teaching, and doing it virtually, kept my mind elsewhere.

Now its a new school year and things are starting to get back to normal, and I'm afraid they may realize they never got my certificate and will request it. Only problem is now Im afraid to go get it notarized at this point because it will reflect that I taught for an entire year without having a notarized teaching certificate. I am curious if this opens me up to any issues.

CoSport is the (scummy) official seller of Olympics tickets in the United States. When foreigners were banned from the Olympics back in March, CoSport announced an incredibly shady ""refund"" policy in which they'd withhold 20% of the purchase price as a non-refundable service fee (https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2021-04-01/olympic-ticket-refunds is a good article on the issue).

Anyways, I had purchased Olympics tickets from CoSport on two occasions, once with my credit card (order #12345) and once with my debit card (order #67890). After CoSport announced their refund policy, I initiated a dispute with the credit card company for order #12345, and I won the chargeback a few months ago.

However, I was still due a refund for the separate purchase I made with my debit card (#67890). CoSport began mailing checks this month. I went online to check on the status of this refund, only to discover that CoSport has suspended my account and is refusing to refund me for the second transaction. When I contacted them, they indicated that they would not refund me unless I paid the charge back fees they incurred by losing the dispute on the entirely unrelated purchase (#12345). They literally just sent me an invoice that was basically ""$100 (refund I am owed) - $90 (chargeback fees) = $10,"" and then asked me if I consented to that.

So my questions:

1) Is this even legal? I legitimately won the chargeback on the first order, and the order they still owe me the refund for is entirely unrelated to the chargeback.

This is incredibly minor and really just a case of not wanting to be taken advantage of if possible.

We were on a month to month lease with a 30 day notice to move out required. We bought a house, gave 30 days the day we closed to be on the safe side, and vacated 3 days later. We paid rent for the full 30 days after giving notice in advance. We returned keys as the landlord told us they wanted to rent it out right away. We canceled water, power, moved internet, the usual. We ended up getting billed for water for the 2 week period after we had moved out. Oh well, no big deal. 

We are about 40 days since returning keys and still don't have our deposit back.  Deadline in Oregon is 31 days from move out Land lord tried once but is not capable of writing a check correctly so we had to ask for it to be sent again. At that point the LL got a water bill for weeks 3 and 4 after our move out and is now deducting that from our deposit refund. I'm all for paying my bills, but that was a solid 2-4 weeks after we had access to the unit and during a time when the land lord was presumably irrigating and generally using their utilities. 

I failed at googling, but it seems to me if we are not using the utilities and don't live there, aren't we within our rights to cancel? When I called the city to check on the bill they seemed like this was standard for the landlord to pay. 

The sum of of money is about $50. I am very fortunate that where I am now this amount of money doesn't matter to me, and I don't expect to need a housing reference in the future. In the past when getting a deposit back or other rental issues did mean a lot to me, I didn't feel like I was in a spot to be tough with a landlord. I feel like I need to stick up for myself here to help future tenants. We had a host of other complaints throughout the rental time and just generally feel this landlord is unprofessional and unaware of the legal side of being a landlord.

That was the original post. I have reported the dog owner to animal control and they are investigating the attack to determine if dog is dangerous.

The owner agreed to pay for the costs of the treatment and surgery but backed down once the bill came (approximately $8k). She is now getting estimates from other places and she's saying the procedure was overpriced and would pay the lowest estimate she receives. She is also saying that it was a dog fight and not an attack even though her dog got loose, ran 20 feet straight to my dog and my dog never even fought back.

Mind you, I'll be taking this to small claims court if she does not pay the full amount. My issue is, would the judge determine that she's in the right? Was it my responsibility to get the lowest cost of care for my dog? I'm thinking if she damaged my car in an accident of her fault, she doesn't get to say where I go to get it repaired, but not sure if that same situation applies to property damage.

I didn't want to take this to court what with having to deal with my wife getting rear ended a few days before the attack and my 8-month old son getting a fever a week after. Frankly, I've got my hands full and just want this to be resolved quickly. That's also part of the reason why we chose to go to the hospital for the surgery; it was the highest rated one and we were ready to pay whatever was needed to treat our dog.

After being hired, I notified the contract company that I was trans-gendered and requested that I be addressed appropriately.

On reporting to my worksite, which is a mixture of civilian contractors and active military personnel, I found over a year of projects backed up and jumped in head-first to tackle this pile of work.  The issues started when my company project manager continued to misgender me, of which I very politely reminded him numerous times.  It wasn't until leaders with the military customer (who are all VERY supportive) took the PM aside and warned him to respect my pronouns.  After that, he did! Problem solved, right?  

No. I was informed that the PM was AGAIN warned by the military for misgendering me-  but only behind my back.  In addition to this, he became constantly aggressive with me, especially in the presence of the rest of the team and during meetings, accusing me of things that were provably untrue or for things he didn't understand.  He was AGAIN privately admonished by the military for this.

This behavior got progressively worse over several months; all this while was I receiving numerous documented ""atta-girls"" from the military team for my progress in clearing up the previous watch's mess.  I certainly wasn't going to let him get me on performance. You get the picture.  

To make this story much shorter, I'll wrap it up: Myself and 2 of the contractor coworkers who witnessed this behavior approached HR as a group to report again on this issue (and others).  HR responded with hostility, dismissed the complaints, and gave all 3 of us negative counseling statements in our files. The harassment continued, and I had my customer assigned telework days taken away without a valid reason. At one point, military leadership approached me privately and asked me, ""Don't you feel like the PM's discriminating against you because you're Trans?""  Of course he was; I face discrimination out in the world every damn day.  It had just finally gotten to the point where it was impacting my ability to do my job. Every. Single. Day.

This week I notified my contracting company that if nothing would be done, I was giving my notice of resignation.  HR finally reached out to me 2 days later, the results were expected. I was the problem, and they were just going to try to sweep this under the rug.  The head of HR even told me that my ""behavior was endangering the contract.""

I told them I understood I would need to get it installed by a certified electrician and pay for the install myself, increase my rent insurance to $1M, my rent would increase, etc. I'm only looking for a level 1/110v plug to be installed. 

Today they replied that they are unable accommodate my request.

We did end up begrudgingly signing a stipulation and at this point we're waiting for her home to be sold but everything that's supposed to happen is in the stipulation we all, including both attorneys, signed.

Over the last several years, a certain stock has been the target of predatory illegal actions in which the market makers of said stock own a monopoly over retail trading. This has costed retail millions in damages to a stock that should be performing well.

A sufficient amount of evidence has been uncovered in favor of my (and over 500,000+ people's) thesis. Legal experts have previously been consulted within this community on what the next step should be, but it usually comes back to informing the regulatory bodies that are meant to *regulate* it in the first place.

In the past, the SEC has (on many occasions) found the perpetrators to be guilty of these acts of fraud and manipulation, but has only punished the bad actors with fines insignificant to the profit that was made using the manipulative practices. This has not served as a punishment to them, but has encouraged the hedge funds and Co. to continue in their practice because they know the fine they will receive is far smaller than the profit made, and to them it is simply the 'cost of doing business.'

My question to all of you is, what can be done as a retail investor, or as a lawyer, to protect our assets from this scale of fraud? To keep the economy from suffering from the same practices that were outlawed as a result of the 2008 recession, and subsequently the market crash, is there any way to pursue these bad actors legally in order to protect the market from repeating history?

So I'm living in New Zealand in a hostel, I'm from the UK. (separate from the main hostel, just a separate house for long-term guests), and we recently all went into lockdown. The rules are no noise after 10pm.

I'm living with this kiwi guy and he's constantly playing loud music, like, I have complaints and video recordings as evidence that backup all the way to January when he moved in. I've lived there for over a year. I also have a bunch of Indians that live in the room next to me, 4 of them I think all sharing the room. They talk super loud, the walls are incredibly thin, I can hear everything, all the time whenever I'm not at work, they are talking at full volume and banging around all the time. I put my headphones on to stop hearing them. And I put my fan on when I goto bed to try and drown out the music from the kiwi guy and talking from the Indians. But doesn't work well at all.

So I have to wake up at 3am and be at work for 4am, I work 12 hours a day, 6-7 days a week, it depends. I go to bed at around 7pm. And as described above, it's incredibly difficult to sleep, to the point that I've called in sick a few times, and I'm constantly texting work to let them know I'm going to be late as I just need a few more hours sleep. I get from 1 hours to 5 hours sleep, every day. When I'm late I text them and get an additional 2 hours depending on the severity of how totally fucked I am.

So this kiwi guy broke covid rules last night. His music was super loud so I went and asked him to turn it down, which I do a lot. Errm, I'll post the email I sent.

""Hi,


So the Kiwis Name opposite my room was playing music, talking and laughing extremely loud, and slamming doors at all hours, the last door slam woke me up at 2am. The kicker to all this is that he had a friend in his room that is NOT in the hostel bubble.

This is a serious offense and came extremely close to calling the police, but wasn't sure if that was an overreaction, but have since learnt from work colleagues that it would have been the appropriate action to take.


I knocked on his door at 9.30 asking him to turn it down originally, but before knocking I heard a girl in there. I asked him if she was a guest at the hostel, to which he replied no. I asked him if he's aware that there's a level 4 lockdown currently in effect and she can't be here, he said he understood, and I told him that she has to leave. He said ok. So they both drive off at 10 ish. I have this whole interaction recorded and he admits to having someone in there that shouldn't be. Now the thing is, he came back but hid his van, and I'm pretty sure I heard two pairs of footsteps go back into his room. But have no evidence of this. The music continued for hours. He even decided to play loud drama soaps of women and men talking loudly so I wouldnt be able to determine if she was back in there. This continued until 3am. I had to message work, AGAIN, saying that I will be coming in late due to lack of sleep. 


This has happen so many times it's actually insane to the point that I will refuse to pay rent if I am being woken up constantly resulting in myself being sleep deprived and either going in late, or not at all sometimes due to lack of sleep, resulting in myself losing out on money.


I want this guy removed as soon as possible. I don't appreciate being woken up at all hours and having my health at risk due to his complete and utter lack of respect and common sense. I am very tempted to escalate this further.


Regards,
My Name.""

The response:

""Dear My Name, thanks for raising your concerns, I understand your frustration and yes the Kiwis Name should not have had other people here at Hostel Name. I will speak to him when he returns. My concern is your expectation that all resident activities in the house must revolve around your work commitments. Unfortunately that is not possible in the house you live in and I have no other room that would be suitable. My only suggestion is that you consider moving into a facility that is able to provide you with the level of quiet that you require to maintain your health needs.""

So I got a little angry, but didn't mean to send this next email, I wanted to expand on it. But accidently sent:

""That is the most bullshit response I've ever read. Wow. It's not revolving around my work schedule, there are rules in place that need to be followed, which are not being followed. It's as simple as that. If you like I'll slam doors, play music, and be super loud when I wake up, I really don't mind.""

It's just really frustrating, I've emailed so many times it's unreal. I just dont know what to do anymore. I've tried. I can't just move out at level 4, it's not allowed. And there no where available even if it were allowed.

A few years ago, I was involved in a serious near fatal accident with a drunk driver. My car looked like a crumbled soda can, very lucky to be alive. Had to have therapy for almost a year, and even now there are some long term effects I suffer with. Unfortunately as soon as the driver hit me, they jumped out the vehicle and fled the scene by foot (police say the vehicle was stolen and no leads). I had a glimpse of the person, and the fled when they saw I called 911.

So I did what most people suggest, obtained a lawyer and went to therapy. The lawyer assured me they would do everything in their power, and the main thing was for me to get well first. At the same time, we are trying to do a UM claim within my own insurance. So nearly a year passes, I'm done with therapy, and the lawyer is ready to move forward to submit the medical. She advises me that she could not find any information on the the driver or owner of the car insurance, or anything, and the best situation was to go sue my own insurance/file a suit against them since they were literally offering nothing near my medical, and not offering anything reasonable for my um coverage. So I proceed.

**What happened after the accident:**

 Little did I know what was to be. It has been several years since, and I have had over 4 attorneys (not by request, I call about the case and I'm assigned attorney or speaking to a paralegal 90% of the time), most of which came ill prepared during mediation/deposition/skype sessions with the insurance company. I have heard every excuse from: I'm getting assigned to this attorney because the first one only handles the case before a civil suit has been filed, the other one was busy during hurricane harvey, my case got pushed back 2 years due to the hurricane, then this lawyer had surgery, the next lawyer quit, the courts are backed after Covid hit, the next lawyer this, etc. 

One of the problems with this case is that the insurance company is denying the policy amount I had, and stating I had none or it was much lower than when the accident occurred (depending on what coffee they are drinking it can be either or lol). I went about a month an half before the accident and increased my um coverage. Then after the accident, they claim that change was less than a month old before the changes went effect, and therefore they believe they will be victorious in court and a small amount is the best they could offer since I cant prove otherwise. When I visited my local agent after the accident and explained what happened, they told me that I had nothing to worry about and if they had to, they could retroactively go back and adjust the dates so that I am covered since the date I made changes was nearly a month before my renewal (I have evidence to prove this), and I just would have to pay more in my premium.  

I decided to do some due diligence myself, and when I called their headquarters, one rep assured me the policy coverage I am claiming is correct and they could send me proof, but would have to do a historic policy request through underwriting . Just like you would think, underwriting sent out a letter of notice stating they would need more information before they can forward any retroactive information.  My attorney said that rep has a vague name and without some type of badge number that would not hold up in court with a statement of their rep confirming, but I have proof with the letter right around that time, so who knows.

Also, the agent that originally said would do some background work to make sure I had nothing to worry about (not sure if this would help in court) was  subpoenaed by my lawyer for their records and he basically changed his narrative stating what the insurance company says (that I had probably had no um and that the change was less than a month old). So clearly caught this person in a lie, and the lawyer I have is stating well this could fall under E&amp;O, and maybe that  wont hold up in court (the other lawyer I had before them said the opposite, suggesting that the agent provided us false information).

The latest lawyer I have is working nearly the last minute before trial and is telling me that the best thing to do is take the very little insulting offer the insurance company offered with a deadline, because they (the lawyer I have now) sees no other way to get any higher settlement, and that going to trial would mean their fee (my lawyer) would increase, and I most likely would get next to nothing (we are talking about the price of a new iphone lol). The insurance company also stated that if the offer isnt accepted by the deadline they will also file a lawsuit against me (I have no idea how any why)?

I never have been in accident, gone to trial, or been through anything like this, and its very stressful, and I'm not sure what to do at this point? I understand nothing on here should be taken as legal advice, but I just wanted to know do i have any options, and it just feels like crazy at the moment. I'm being lead to believe that going to trial is something where: the dates will most likely be pushed back again, that there are no other options in my case, that even if I win the fully policy amount, I will come out with far less than settling out of trial (that the lawyer is taking more than 39%+ more fees), that most likely I will walk away with a enough money to just buy a iphone 12 pro max with no apple care (lol), and that I  will then be sued by my own insurance company for filing a um suit, and that my law firm would charge to represent me.",legaladvice,Do good lawyers exist?

Considering an offer from a Contractor (as defined in the contract language; what I would normally call a “contractor/recruiter”). The Contractor co is in NJ. 

The Company / customer / client is global, lots of locations. This position will be entirely remote - me working from home. The location of the project’s Company employees is neither NJ or AL. 

I “the Consultant” am in AL. 

The language in the Contract and Purchase Order is conflicted about termination. At one point it says “not before one month and 15 days”. Also that the Consultant may not terminate before one month. Then either party may terminate with 15 days. And finally, that the Contractor may terminate at any time if the Company terminates the Master Agreement for any reason. 

Essentially, it sounds like this all reinforces “at will” presumption, and worst case scenario, I could guarantee 15 days of work/payment. 

In common language: I have a paying gig. I feel like in order to accept the risks involved in giving that up, I should ask for a presumption of employment for the full 12 months unless the Contractor or Company has “good cause” for termination. 12 months security is a drop in the bucket for a global Fortune 500 with multi-Billion revenue. 

(A) Is this reasonable? 
(B) I assume a company / contractor *can* constrain themselves willingly by contract, more than the presumption of “at will”- but are they likely to? 

I’m hoping someone familiar with this type of employment contract will tell me something like, “They will start with the presumption of ‘at will’, but they are likely to concede ‘for cause’ if you press the point and negotiate it.” 

I would say I’m in a moderately rare position, but not a 1:1M irreplaceable rockstar. It’s a roughly $125k job.

I lived in a house full of students from sept 2020-July 2021. The Rent for the House is $5700 Split between 7 inhabitants. As long as I’ve lived there, if a room is vacant, no one is responsible for that rent. Rent is charged by which room you inhabit. This is agreed upon by word of mouth it’s not in writing anywhere.

My mom came to visit me for 1.5 months and stayed In my house. She stayed in my bedroom, sometimes on the livingroom couch, sometimes on the garage couch, and sometimes in one of the vacant rooms (we had 2 vacant rooms at the time). 

I moved out july 30th and have asked the landlord multiple times for the return of my deposit. After the third email. He responded with this yesterday:

Accounting: 
Deposit    $600

Offset  Takeover of John Doe Housemate’s room for a month and a half = $880 + $440 = $1320.

Balance Owed  $1320 - $600 = $720 


from this, I understand that he’s trying to make me pay for John Doe’s empty room that he moved out of because my mom stayed sometimes during her visit. 

In the past, we have had friends/boyfriends/guests stay at our house for varying lengths of time and no one was ever asked to pay rent for that space. They’re guests. 

After I moved out, John Doe housemate asked me for money fir the room to cover his rent. We never agreed to anything like that beforehand so I said no. Eventually I felt bad and I paid housemate John Doe $400 over Venmo to help with the room. Now my landlord is not acknowledging that amount that I paid John Doe housemate so basically John Doe pocketed the money for himself and told the landlord to go after me for the whole amount. 

There’s nothing in writing or ever spoken where I ever agreed to pay rent for that room. 

Can the landlord sue ME ? can I sue for the return of the deposit? Do I need to prove I do not owe the rent ?

8 years ago I had a very nasty break up in the middle of a move. All of my belongings had been packed by movers that were part of my ex's separation from the  Army. We lived in Florida when the belongings were packed but as a result of our breakup backed out of buying the home we were moving to and the contents of the truck were delivered to my ex's parents home in North Carolina. 

Immediately after delivery his mother offered to drive my belongings to me but I was living in my car at the time and had no where to store it. She said she would hold it until I got on my feet. 

It took a year to do that, and when I asked to come get my things I was told she couldn't find them and it would have to wait until the ex's next visit. I asked several other times and was always put off. 

It has now been 8 years and I still do not have my property. I was mailed my mother's ashes, but have not received anything else. It was the contents of an entire home and basically everything my son and I owned. Furniture, electronics, clothes, kitchen supplies but more importantly irreplaceable family photos, keepsakes and book. Lots and lots of books. I honestly have replaced most things now but my photos and my books still eat at me. I want them back. 

While I wanted out of this relationship as much as he did, I suffered great loss as a result. All money we put toward the purchase of the home was forfeit as we breached contract (not my idea, I wanted to keep the home and refinance as soon as I legally could so only I was the owner but he was primary buyer backed out without telling me)that was basically all of my savings. I left my job as we were moving 2 hours away, but was unable to start at the new position I accepted due to my son. While I lived in n my car he lived with his grandmother but I was still his primary caregiver and needed to remain close to him.  It is difficult to find work without an address, and to save up enough money to start from scratch which is why it took a year to get an apartment. I did not want to waste my limited money on a storage unit for my belongings when I was told they didn't mind storing them for me. I was told it was the least they could do considering the circumstances. 

TLDR do I have any claim to personal property that was moved 8 years ago I was never able to recover? Is this now considered abandoned property?

I have lived in my apartment complex for almost 6 years now. 

I have never had any complaints, I have never had any issues, no problems, never late on rent, or any other bill for that matter. I'm quiet. I stay to myself. Etc.

Today is Thursday. I work night shift, and Wednesday night I woke up incredibly nauseous. I called out of work. And went to sleep on the couch with my torso raised so I wouldn't feel so bad.

After a while, I woke up and made food. I still wasn't feeling great. But I wasn't tired anymore and couldn't go back to sleep. So I stayed up for a bit. Eventually I went back to bed at a little after 1:34p (I made a purchase and the receipt was time stamped then).

I was woken up to a knock on the door at 2:30p. I figured it was the mailman. He sometimes does that. So I rolled back over. Then I woke up to my door opening and someone with heavy footsteps walking inside. 

Undstandably I was concerned. I was asleep in my birthday suit. And some unknown person just walked into my apartment.

When I said 'Who the Fu*ck is in my house?' as I was throwing on clothes to go figure out what the problem was I was greeted with the sounds ""I gotta check the water heater"". (Note, there was no 24 hr notice to this).

The guy left about 20 seconds or so later. 

I went back to sleep.

Well a few hours later I get up and find my door unlocked. (The guy didn't bother to lock it when he left). And a notice of termination of lease stuck in my door frame. 

-------------------------

Ill wake up to a pin drop. So I know noone else was in my house. 

Whoever put the note on my door didn't knock. Didn't make any attempt to let me know of anything happening. 

The office closed at 5:00 pm. And it was 5:09 pm.

I got the big head office phone number. And called. The lady who runs the whole place answered. And asked if this was an emergency. I said it was. She then rattled off the maintenance people's numbers. I told her I just woke up to a termination of lease. She said that she was t""tired"" and had ""worked all day"" and that the office hours were ""8am to 5pm"" and when I pressed the issue and it's importance, I was hug up on. 

Now I'm sitting here before work. Unbelievably angry that some maintenance guy, who came into my house without so much as letting me know he was maintenance, decided that my house was in 'unacceptable condition' and that the office people, who were informed of this, didn't see fit to let me know, call me, ask me anything, make a visit to check on things, etc. Just decided to ""make the management decision of terminating my lease"". And then silently put it on my door sometime between 2:30p and 5:08pm.

------------------------

I have no idea what to do. I know that what they have done is borderline illegal due to not giving notice of entering the apartment. 

But my house is clean. Albiet it is in the middle of my work week, and I was sick the day before. So there's like a pan sitting on the stove I cooked in, and a paper bowl that I ate Mac and cheese from that was sitting on my table next to the couch. But it's nothing 'kick him out' bad.

I just... Don't know what to do.

I fully intend to move. Even if they are in the wrong, as they have done many sketchy things like this before. But I cany leave on 42 days notice. Especially if I'm still paying my bills and they keep my saftey deposit and rent.

I don't know how to put pictures on here to show both the letter, and the supposedly 'unacceptable condition' of my apartment. (Spoiler, it's not).

we both mostly agree that it would be the best to try and make enough progress that we have some stuff to show off, to maybe try to get some other people to join the project or begin some sort of fan following.

aside from that he thinks it would be good to upload the art anyway, to see if i could join other projects or sell assets.

&amp;#x200B;

my IP concern is that uploading the art, showing off the project would make it obvious how its designed, and a more competent team could easily surpass our progress and make the game themselves, if they wanted.

its probably also worth noting that I'm the only one with this concern, programmer doesn't care.

My 10 day old (at the time) Tesla Model 3 was parked in a parking spot while I was in a store. When I got back in the car I saw the sentry cam footage of someone trying to pull into the spot next to me, scratching my car, and backing out and driving off. I was able to identify the make/model of the other car as well as their license plate. I called the police and filed an accident report, but since there were no witnesses and the other party was not present it just states ""Driver of vehicle one states..."" Honestly the damage isn't terrible and if it were an older car I'd probably just move on. 

I called my insurance company (State Farm) and they said I could pay for the repairs out of pocket while they investigate, and if the other party is found to be at fault then I'd be reimbursed. I don't want to pay for anything out of pocket so they advised that I contact the other party's insurance (AllState) and open a claim with them. So I did that, uploaded the video evidence, provided the license plate number, everything. Open and shut case right? Wrong. Finally, two weeks later, I get a call from them saying they can't clearly make out the license plate number, they can't identify who was driving the other vehicle, they can't confirm the footage is of my vehicle, they can't tell the other vehicle hit my vehicle.

I need some help figuring out if there is any legal action we can take for this situation. I assume not but still wondering... and we live in ontario. Appreciate the help!

Basically a few months ago, a tenant on the second floor of our building (we live on the first) put food down their sink drain and clogged it. This caused the super to have to come on to unclog it. That worked out fine but (we assume) it accidentally created a small hole in the wall somewhere which allowed roaches to infest our apartment. We had a roach extermination done (which by the way, we were informed of the time the guy would get here after he was already here) now the extermination worked for a whole of 20 minutes. But seriously roaches came back. We annoyed the super multiple times for the next months to do the extermination again but they never did until now (approx. 3 to 4 maybe more months later. I dont remember the exact date). By now its too late and all the roaches have taken over the entire apartment (bedroom, washroom, living room and kitchen) pretty much forcing us to move out and also throw out a lot of furniture. They may have also infested some tech like our printer and possibly one of our laptops, my ps4, and tv. We have no proof of the requests as we didnt know about work orders as our old super worked without them and these guys apparently dont. We have also been asking them for even longer than a few months to fix other things in our apartment like mouldy ceilings and ripped mesh or grille in our windows and the super even came and took pics of everything yet nothing has been done still about any of this. Even a few weeks after putting a work order in for all of this.

He has been changing details on the listing to be less than what was originally offered.
The new owner has offered to send the lease over but wanted to talk on the phone for a bit beforehand. I agreed and we discussed some questions and concerns and he stated that he would require first months rent, last months rent, and a security deposit upon move in on August 25th and pro rate any days beforehand. 

I replied ""From my understanding, it is illegal under any and all circumstances to ask that in New York State"".

He told me he had a way around it and sent me a letter he had received from an attorney that honestly was quite confusing but stated that 
""My opinion is that you may collect two separate payments, provided you collect the 
funds as separate payments; that you maintain the identity of each payment separately in your 
trust fund accounting; and that during the term of the lease you apply each payment only for its 
intended purpose. As we have discussed, this interpretation is only my own – as far as I know, 
no court has reported a decision on the meaning of this term. I have also told you that my 
opinion appears to be in the minority. Most lawyers with whom I have spoken take the view that 
a landlord can only take the equivalent of one month’s rent, regardless of whether it is applied as 
a “deposit” or an “advance.” Accordingly, no third party should not construe my opinion as legal 
advice to them. They should seek their own counsel."" (This is only a small portion of the letter).

So I am quite confused as to what I can do from here. This is my last option for a place to live before I become homeless. It seems like the ""landlord"" (who doesn't even own the property yet) is doing everything he can to try and dick me around.
In addition to all this, after I emailed him back saying that I was interested in moving forward with the rental, he changed the price from $1,200 to a sliding scale of $1,400-$1,550 per month depending on the amount of people.

So my question is, can this in any way be used to justify last month rent and how should I respond to him? I desperately need a place but will not bend to a slumlord who wants to find ways to circumvent laws and mislead possible tenants.

I reiterated that I am happy to follow up once I have the money to do so but really would like a refill on my meds to avoid a lapse in therapy and the degradation of my mental health. Also, there is a risk of seizures with stopping these meds cold turkey which was my biggest concern in addition to being bipolar and wanting to avoid a flair up. He literally copied and pasted his previous response and that's how he responded. I asked if there is literally anything he can do and he said ""Nope.

Before the accident I drove a electric vehicle, and my apartment complex has complimentary EV charging for residents, so my ""gas"" or running costs of the car are essentially $0. The rental car they are providing me is a gas car that gets about 32-34 mpg. 

I have a bit of a long commute to work, and some quick math shows my gas costs are going to be about $60-70/week basically just driving to/from work until my car is repaired, which I think is a bit unreasonable considering the other person is completely at fault. I've contacted the insurance I have the claim through (Geico) and they just say gas is an out of pocket expense. Everything I've read about GA law regarding rental cars after an auto accident is that the car should be ""similar"" to the car I had before to make up for loss of use, but I am far from a law or insurance expert

This is all taking place in MN.

My sister's boyfriend was at work and using a box cutter when he slipped and fell on some plastic shavings on the floor. The box cutter went right into his hand under his pinky finger. He immediately went to his supervisor and told him what happened and asked to go to the hospital since he noticed that his pinky and ring finger started to go numb and he was unable to move them. His supervisor said no and that just liquid bandage would fix it. Well, his supervisor made him work for an additional 4 hours before he called my sister asking her to pick him up and take him to the hospital. Before he left though the supervisor and the HR rep tried to get him to sign a form saying he refused medical treatment from them (which he didn't sign thankfully). Well it's getting pretty serious. Dr said that the nerve in his hand is severed and he has to have surgery soon.

I asked her today if she could refund me the $100 as I’m no longer getting my hair done from her as I cannot afford to buy new hair.  She refused and said it’s non refundable even though in her policy this is not there.  On top of that, styleseat (where you book the appointment and get charged) charged me $523.75 and I had locked my card so it wouldn’t but I cannot use my card for at least 72 hours (my bank informed me of this).

* Employer retaliation after filing a complaint
* Unwarranted denial of a promotion
* Continued mistreatment by the employer after an employee filed a complaint

Basically, we're two college undergraduate students that rent an apartment near a university with an extremely competitive market and ongoing housing crisis. Our current place is extremely cheap for the market, but you get what you pay for, so about mid-July our bathroom ceiling was leaking pretty badly, then it collapsed (there was an actual hole in the ceiling, you could see the interior of the apartment above's bathtub). We quickly contacted the property manager (not the landlord, the two are separate) about the issue and they were great about coming in and cleaning up, and putting in a temporary fix. Due to the extensive water damage we saw and the potential for injury, however, we attempted to contact the landlord directly and ask if it would be possible for us to A) move to a different available unit in the same complex or B) move out of the complex entirely without giving a 30-day notice, since we'd been staying there long enough that our lease was now month-to-month. 

We were told by the property manager that we couldn't contact the landlord directly, however we could send him what we wanted to say and have done so with the two options listed above; that was two weeks ago, and we've checked in with the property manager to bump the landlord on this subject. He hasn't been responsive, and at this point we're wondering if we might have to take him to small claims court, or threaten to, in order to even get a response or schedule a meeting.

i started going to physical therapy but that’s not something you can keep up with without a car. it’s obviously 3 months later now and i replaced my car but had to get a way less reliable one since i didn’t get enough money from insurance to get an equal quality one. i still can’t even go to physical therapy again because the closest place that my insurance will accept is two towns over and my new car won’t last if i drive that far consistently.

i also never got all of my stuff that was in my totaled car back and they sold it to a junkyard, so i have to buy new stuff out of my own pocket which is not only unfair to me but i literally can’t afford to be buying replacements for all the stuff that was taken from me.

i am overly stressed and anxious because i have to deal w a car that i can’t afford to fix now (when i had an extremely reliable one), no money for anything else, and the fact that i’m still in pain after the accident and can’t afford to go to physical therapy and can’t get insurance money unless i do.

So I recently entered a rental agreement for my first house, a small 7 bedroom with 6 other tenants. We looked around the house months prior to moving in while the previous tenants were staying there and it was in good condition so we went through with signing the contract for this year of uni. I have already paid the deposit and the price of the first 2 months of rent (coming up to ~£1200 so far) but only visited the property a few days ago as my university year hadn’t started yet. 

When I saw the house it was not in the condition I expected at all. There were holes in the doors throughout the house, 6 smashed ceiling lights, horribly dirty mattresses, missing fire extinguishers, a front door lock which doesn’t work properly (in a rough area) as well as other issues including nails sticking out of kicker boards, dirt and stains all over the walls, burn marks on the desks and no room keys for our bedrooms. 

I was just writing this message to ask if there is any legal recourse that can be taken to ensure that the landlord provides us with the house we were promised without us incurring further costs, I am already concerned about them withholding the deposit we have paid at the end of the year to recoup costs of renovation. It’s really shocking given the tens of thousands they are set to make off us that we are effectively living in a crack den.

There was another vehicle on a shoulder at that time. I noticed it and kept driving, and a few seconds later I got hit, so I'm guessing maybe the guy behind me was distracted, didn't notice of the flow and ended up hitting me.

My bumper and trunk seemed to have damage, but it was pretty minor. I could see his driver's license got indented in my bumper.  On his end, his front headlight was busted and that was about it. We pulled to the side and shared both of our information, we took photos of his driver's license and his insurance document. He was pretty short but very apologetic and because the damage seemed minor, we parted ways amicably. No police or witnesses were involved.

I called my insurance company right away, made a claim and but found out my insurance company does not cover liability that doesn't fall on me. So we called his insurance company, and it's been almost a month and their approach is ""we can't get to him, so this case is still pending and we can't admit our/his liability."" I was told today that if the person who hit me continues to not answer the phone call from the insurance company, this claim will eventually be dropped. I'm furious because obviously it's his fault and he gets to just walk away while my car is no longer drivable. It can be entirely coincidental; but my Prius started to have a battery issue with gear not shifting anywhere other than neutral and parking gear. So I opened up the trunk where hybrid and 12v battery are, and there is water in the below trunk space where a spare tire lies. I'm suspecting my bumper had cracks from the collision and the water could've affected the battery. I would love to go get the damage appraised but I can't do anything since the insurance company just sits with the excuse 'we can't get to our insured.'

What is the next best step I can take at this point? I appreciate anyone reading this far and sharing valuable advice/opinions..

PS. My first language isn't English, so please excuse any grammatical errors in this post.

TLDR: I got rear-ended, and the insurance company of the person who hit me couldn't get a hold of the person, and because the company couldn't get the both parties involved, the case is still pending. And if he continues to dodge the phone calls, in a few weeks this claim can be denied.",legaladvice,"I got rear-ended, and because the insurance company can't get a hold of the other party, my claim is about to be denied",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7pixa/i_got_rearended_and_because_the_insurance_company/

My opinion is it's legally stated and signed for.  They had back up offers for more in cash and want go back to those.   Again, they gambled and lost thinking the market was Red Hot, but appraisal aren't there for perceived value, only based on comparable properties.

We had been living at our current complex for about 9 months with no problems. During that time we were paying with money orders. The complex is a bit outdated and there is no option to pay online. We have to put our money into a drop box. One month, we received an eviction letter saying that we had 7 days to pay, or we needed to vacate the property. At this time, we were paying with money orders and we couldn’t immediately prove that we paid. We proved that the money order was purchased, but they accused us of spending it elsewhere. We sent a request to the credit union that distributed the money order, and a little over a month later we had physical proof that the money order was cashed by the apartment complex. I called the police department and started a case because I had proof that they stole our money. Here’s also the catch - it is completely our fault, but we did not sign the money order. But someone at the complex signed their name. 

After I showed her the proof that the apartment complex cashed the check, she apologized so much and gave me a $10 credit for the “inconvenience.”

She told us it was all her fault and it was a slip up on her part, and that she will make sure to be better.

Obviously she didn’t get better because we just received another eviction letter. We learned from our mistake and stopped paying in money orders and switched to checks. This time we can see that the check was cashed by the complex.

\-----------------------------  


***TLDR:*** *Ive been stressed, I went through a divorce and had a job. I lost the job unexpectidly and with little explination as to why. I was in the hospital on monday and I feel like i concussion. Im pretty sure I worked this entire week with symptoms of a mild concussion. I was fired unknowingly and worked an entire week with out knowing.*   


\------------------------------

I am 21 years old and I currently live by myself with my dog, i have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder and I currently have an emotional support dog and have been seeing professional help for my mental health.   


Just a little back story before I start. When covid had started, I was working with dogs and I had just started dealing with some major mental health issues that are still impacting me to this day. My supervisor temporarily laid me off and so I had a job delivering pizzas. I was driving while high every day around town delivering pizzas until I just looked at where i was at in life and I guess i triggered a mental break down. I told the pizza place that Im mentally not okay and I need to stop. After working at the pizza company I applied for unemplyment because I didnt know what else to do and eventually when My job with working with dogs became available again I had to pay everything i collected from unemployment back and was even barred from applying again for a while, although I think i can try again now. But unfortunately I just had not noticed I wasnt in the right category to get unemployment. Imconfused on why they even gave it to me in the first place though.

Previously working through an employment agency in town, I had been from what i believe to be unfairly fired from a job due to mental health issues and just over all daily stress from life its self. I had only missed about 2 days from work and the third i asked to go home early because i mentally didnt feel ok or safe. the employment agency had informed me that they were temperarily going to end my assignment until I said other wise but I was trying not to do that. they insisted and went ahead and did it anyway. the next day i told  them i was okay to go back to work and they were now telling me they had switched me to a morning shift. I was okay with that since it just seemed more convenient but then later that work day on my new shift I was called by the work agency and they informed me that the company didnt want me working there anymore (while im currently working my shift.) That was the end of that job.  


 Around July is when My wife (who also has BPD) and I applied for the same job through the same employment agency in Indiana. We started working at a medical manufacturing company, and the communication has been iffy between the Job, work agency, aswell as me, but not my wife. Around this time My wife and I start getting into arguments every day because she would spend the money we needed on things we honestly didnt need at all, and it got to a point where we were both stressed out every day. In the past, my ex wife had totalled my car and pressured me into buying a new car from a dealership (i dont neccisarily recommend doing that) and we also just recently moved into a pretty expensive apartment aswell. Eventually my wife and I started our new jobs together but in different departments. and we had gone through orientation but they were having some difficulties with orientation aswell. they didnt seem prepared for us new hires at all honestly. We go through the orientation process and everythings good and alright. On our first day of working there, my ex wife was fired because her wrist that was broken from totalling my previous car. Me slightly angry, I go into my supervisors office and talk to my superviser aswell as the company manager about what had just happened and how i felt it was unfair. they insured me it was fair so i didnt press the issue. As time goes by my wife keeps on buying items we dont need and is putting the least amount of effort into finding a new job. One day my brother came over and we just had a long talk and eventually he ended with saying I should leave this woman because he is afraid something bad will happen to me. So I listen to my brother since hes older and has had a wife before too, plus hes way more intelligent then I am. The following day I tell my ex wife everything and in less then 60 days i believe the Clerks office said we will officially be divorced. we signed all the papers and did everything we had to do. My ex wife  left me with my dog, my belongings, and has now moved back in with her family.   


While and after all of what previously was said was happening, I was getting used to my new job, and doing my hardest to be what they needed. I was showing up 15 minutes early every day, and following what others was doing. As I was going through the divorce process I had been going to work stressed out very badly, I couldnt sleep, and I was just getting overwhlemed with life.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is where things start going down hill with my new job. There are two times where I personally messed up on accident. There was a time I went on break and accidentally fell asleep in my car because ive never worked this much in my life, and then a nother time where I was on my break, i wanted somewhere quiet to go and they have these rooms with a chair and a fridge in them, so i went in there and closed the door because i hate eating in the cafiteria since theres so many people. after a bit both my supervisor and the company manager knock on the door and start yelling at me and pointing at a sign. It turned out i had accidentally thought a ""Lactation"" room was just a normal room. but then they were also yelling at me because they said im not supposed to be on break, while my entire department was on break. 

Then There were days where I was crying through my entire shift, and had even told the Company manager what was happening, and he sympathized and related by sharing a story of his own with me. I had missed one day due to not feeling well, and then just recently I had missed a day because while I was outside I had blacked out and smacked the back of my head on the ground pretty hard. I was ambulanced to a hospital and I literally could not even move the right side of my body, and my right eye had started to darken. I was in a panick attack and the EMT's were being so rude to me and treating me like i was some homeless person for some reason, and the entire time they were putting things in my face and asking me to sign them but i had no idea what they were. they were explaining what it was but i couldnt comprehend what they were explaining so I had refused to sign every paper at the hospital that night. I had to call into work again this Monday and I even had a doctors note that I took a picture of to show my supervisor. This entire week, I belive I am suffering from a concussion and Ive even had many people look at the back of my head and say they see bruises and marks. My heart rate hasnt been what it usually it, Im foggy, and its some times exhausting to even walk to the firdge and back to my computer chair i feel like im showing signs of a concussion but I also feel like the Hospital shouldn have known if i had one or not. they did an MRI and everything on me. When I was at the hospital they just let me go in the middle of the night and I had to walk home. I was confused, and I think it was because I had not signed any thing they gave me, but i couldnt even comprehend that single thought process until a couple days had passed.   


Today, I was told informed by the company manager the work agency had been trying to get ahold of me, even though my phone had 0 incoming calls from them and ive revieced 0 emails from them, and he told me I needed to call them back. So i go outside and call me, and the person I call couldnt even help me and told me everyones in a meeting and the place closes in an hour ""ill tell someone to call you"" the girl on the phone said to me. I go back inside and find the Company Manager, and he then tells me that I had 7 occurances and the max amount you could have was 5. I had no idea that i was even accumilating occurances, and I swear ive heard people say you can only miss like 3 or 4 days, and as far as i was aware of, I had only missed 2. The company Manager tells me Im being let go and that I need to give my uniform to him and that I WAS APPARENTLY FIRED ON MONDAY, but no one told me until Thursday??? So I try to defend myself and explain i didnt even know i had 7, I asked him to tell me what each one was and he wouldnt even tell me. All he had said is that he didnt want to argue. I didnt press the issue, I left and now im home.  


I was talking with some friends on Twitch and they brought up that I might qualify for Unemployment, or maybe even Work Comp. Im honestly not even sure what to do right now as I feel like i cant really even think properly most of the time.

I am a military veteran pursuing a college degree and living on a limited income. I financially supported my now ex-girlfriend for four years and ran myself into a financial crisis due to me paying the majority (&gt;75% of all expenses) of the bills in our household. While I was struggling to make ends meet for the both of us on my limited income, she lied about her income to saved money outside of my knowledge and to avoid paying half of our rent and utilities. We agreed that the bills would be split 50/50 from the beginning as soon as we both were in a financial position to afford it. A few months ago, she lied about the income she was receiving from unemployment, leading me to believe that she was making less than she was. We both signed a new 13-month lease in an apartment that I cannot afford on my own because she wanted to live somewhere with more space. I did this with the intentions that she would be paying half of the rent and utilities because she started her first professional job out of college, utilizing her recently acquired bachelor’s degree in which she is making considerably more income. Within one month of us signing the lease and her starting that job, she ended the relationship. My current lease ends October 3rd and the new lease begins October 4th . A 60 days’ notice is required to move out. After speaking to the leasing office, they say I have two options:

1. I give 60 days’ notice that I am moving out and, by doing so, I cancel the new lease that we both signed, free and clear. Because this 60 days’ notice will extend past my current lease date, I would have to pay the month-to-month price, which is near double the cost of rent, for at least a month, if not longer, due to that fact that I’ll have trouble finding a place because of my income. 

2. I do not move out or break the lease. She will be required to stay on the new lease, as the lease states that at least one person make 3x the rent and she is the only person to meet that qualification. 

It seems like I must choose between losing a ton of money and risking not having an apartment to live in, or stay in the current apartment I can’t afford on a lease with someone who is leaving me. I think the fairest outcome would be for her to at least pay for half of the rent and utilities for this new 13-month lease, an obligation we both agreed to fulfill to each other and to the contract holder. If this gets messy, is there a legitimate chance of me getting some of the money I’m out of? If not, what would change that? I plan on discussing these issues with her in the coming days, but I do not expect her to be cooperative in the least. Any input or advice on the situation, whether it be legal or personal advice, would be helpful.

My roommate and I just applied for and were approved for a new apartment. The property manager is now asking for a holding deposit, because we won't be moving in immediately, which will turn into our security deposit. However, I asked to see the lease before sending over the deposit, but she said "" It is not possible to send a CAA lease before hand.""

I understand the need for security and holding deposits, but I don't like that I cannot see the documents.

I've already toured the apartment, and met the property manager in person, and I think that everything should be good, but I don't want to be sending 2k+ before seeing anything I'm going to be signing.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved out of our apartment on 2021-07-31. The property manager inspected the apartment with us on 2021-07-26. They asked for some things to be cleaned and we did, when they looked at it again on 2021-07-31 they seemed happy with the improvements. In August, we email them several times asking when we can expect our deposit back and hear no response from them. On 2021-08-17, we receive a receipt from them asking to keep $1,000 from the deposit, with entries as vague as ""$300 - painting, $400 cleaning"". 

&amp;#x200B;

We feel we are entitled to the entirety of our deposit for several reasons:

* we were not given a chance to make any repairs/cleaning, and not told that any more were needed
* the attorney general's tenants' rights guide ([https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants\_rights.pdf](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tenants_rights.pdf)) says:

&gt;If the landlord does not provide this receipt within 14 days of the tenant moving out, they must return the entire security deposit, whether there is damage or not.

That 14 day window lapsed, even provided that 2021-08-16 was a Monday and the first business day at the end of the 14 day window. The landlord continues to insist that the law means 14 business days. We have asked the NY attorney general to send a letter on behalf through their web form.

&amp;#x200B;

We would appreciate advice on this matter in a few aspects:

1. Is it a bad idea to accept the rest of the deposit from the landlord? Would this signify that we had reached an agreement, and aren't due the remainder of the deposit? 
2. Is the 14 days part too much of a technicality, or is it strictly enforced? The tenants' rights guide is unambiguous about this, I just don't know that 17 days would really be too late to be enforced.
3. If the AG does send a letter and the landlord ignores it, would it be a good idea to hire a lawyer for small claims court? This case seems obvious in our favor, but we don't have a legal background.

Thanks in advance for your help.",legaladvice,[NYC] Landlord wants to keep $1000 from security deposit after giving sketch receipt late,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7pajw/nyc_landlord_wants_to_keep_1000_from_security/

My ex (35m) and I (35f) have been divorced for a year now. Things were pretty civil between us during the separation and first few months following the finalization of the divorce. We had an uncontested divorce with me being primary custodian of the children. He has them ever Thursday &amp; every 1st 3rd &amp; 5th weekend of the month. 

The past few months he has done a 180. He's no longer civil making it so hard to co parent with him. He keeps threatening to try and take custody of the kids (ages 7 &amp; 11). 

He had them for the full month of July. When I got the girls back, I found out from them that he has been discussing details about the divorce in front of them. He told them I had an affair (this was during our separation).

He has been harassing me, calling me non stop, leaving voicemails screaming at me. The kids told me he does this right in front of them. They said they've asked him not to do that, or at least go outside or his bedroom bc they don't want to hear it. They both said being over there makes them anxious (younger one used the word nervous). 

He took them out of town and while he was driving he texted me the whole time. I found out later from our kids that he was using voice to text and my responses were being read over the speakers. All of this conversation very much not appropriate for the kids to hear. 

He calls me names to them and has made it very clear he hates me. My youngest asked me ""what does lose custody mean?"" He told them I was going to lose custody. 

He missed seeing them off on their 1st day of school bc he failed to try to make arrangements with me days prior. He called me the morning of, while I was getting the kids ready, told the girls I ""made it impossible for him to come take pics on their 1st day of school."" I told him when we were leaving for school that morning and he never showed up. Yet, he's somehow blaming me and has told the kids that he had been asking me for days and I ignored him. Couldn't be further from the truth. 

As much as I want to show them texts and explain exactly why he's lying, I'm not going to because they don't need to be involved in this. 

His attempts of turning the kids against me has failed (so far anyway). I'm unsure if they just don't believe him or if they're just trying to ignore it. I have scheduled family counseling for the 2 of them. 

I'm concerned he's going to continue doing this and eventually they'll start to believe him. It terrifies me. I don't even want them going over to his place anymore bx of the stress he causes them. Unfortunately my attorney told me since there's no physical or sexual abuse, a judge won't take away his right to visitation.

Long story shortish, hes been with this toxic piece of filth for about 6 years, thought he had 2 kids with her for a few of those years turns out she cheated and lied and they aren't his. Well hes a sucker for pain cause he stayed with her and had another kid that is his. 

About her, shes been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and is addicted to meth, signed the rights away to the other 2 kids then signed his kid over to her friend (as he wasn't on the birth certificate though he is now). Fast forward and shes (obviously) an unfit mom and is rarely ever around, chases every guy she sees and will uproot herself on a whim though she's still legally married to my brother.  She has no stability. So she was living with my brother for a while and he had a good friend that watched her for free until she went back to school. So he was in a bind as he doesn't have a license or a ton of cash for daycare so me and my fiance took her in so he could get his life straight and apparently now thinks she wants to try her hand at being a mom. Even says shes hardly smoking any meth but calls herself clean.  So now shes coming at my fiance with threats and saying terrible shit. Go figure though were helping her out. Not trying to keep her from seeing her kid but I do have apprehensions about handling her over to an unstable, crazy, meth addict. 

So my question is what legal route do I need to take that's the quickest and most efficient way to knock her back down to the lowest part of the earth where she belongs and give this cute little kiddo a better life while my brother gets back on track?

I lived in a house full of students from sept 2020-July 2021. The Rent for the House is $5700 Split between 7 inhabitants. As long as I’ve lived there, if a room is vacant, no one is responsible for that rent. Rent is charged by which room you inhabit. This is agreed upon by word of mouth it’s not in writing anywhere.

My mom came to visit me for 1.5 months and stayed In my house. She stayed in my bedroom, sometimes on the livingroom couch, sometimes on the garage couch, and sometimes in one of the vacant rooms (we had 2 vacant rooms at the time). 

I moved out july 30th and have asked the landlord multiple times for the return of my deposit. After the third email. He responded with this yesterday:

Accounting: 
Deposit    $600

Offset  Takeover of John Doe Housemate’s room for a month and a half = $880 + $440 = $1320.

Balance Owed  $1320 - $600 = $720 


from this, I understand that he’s trying to make me pay for John Doe’s empty room that he moved out of because my mom stayed sometimes during her visit. 

In the past, we have had friends/boyfriends/guests stay at our house for varying lengths of time and no one was ever asked to pay rent for that space. They’re guests. 

After I moved out, John Doe housemate asked me for money fir the room to cover his rent. We never agreed to anything like that beforehand so I said no. Eventually I felt bad and I paid housemate John Doe $400 over Venmo to help with the room. Now my landlord is not acknowledging that amount that I paid John Doe housemate so basically John Doe pocketed the money for himself and told the landlord to go after me for the whole amount. 

There’s nothing in writing or ever spoken where I ever agreed to pay rent for that room. 

Can the landlord sue ME ? can I sue for the return of the deposit?

So I was using a dating app you have to be at least 18 or older to be on these apps.  I matched with an eighteen-year-old girl and we started talking.  I sent her a message saying hey cutie and right away she goes text me and give it to me a number a number for my area.  We start texting and out of nowhere she starts to send me some pictures of her in her underwear. Things got sexual very quick she was the one who started it.  She sends me pictures and videos and I go back to the dating app and I noticed her profile is gone.  Well later on she says she has to tell me something she tells me that she will be 17 in a month.  I tell her she looks cute but we shouldn't do this anymore.  Then she tries to guilt me and then says we're not doing anything wrong because it's legal age of consent.  I tell her maybe hit me up when she turns 18 because I don't really know what the laws are and I'm not trying to take any chances.  Well anyways a few days later I get attacked from her phone number.  It's a man claiming to be her father and that I'm in trouble for cp and I need to call him.  This freaks me out so bad I had a panic attack and started bawling my eyes out.  I didn't know what to do I panicked and I destroyed my phone to get rid of evidence.

Me and my 3 roommates came back to a half finished apartment where only our bedrooms had been absolutely gutted. No flooring. No trim. The living area and kitchen had not been touched. We agreed to let them continue as long as we had our bedrooms finished by the end of the next day. Once our bedrooms were finished they gutted the living area and it remained that way for two weeks. My roommates and I had no other place to go so we dealt with it.

8 months later our kitchen remained in a half finished state and just recently ( due to new leases moving in ) they contacted all apartments in the building stating all apartments were to be finished in the next week. 

Still nothing.

But because of my reduced motility, I won’t be able to travel again soon— especially with my immunocompromised status. But no one is traveling anyway because of the delta variant so I’m confused as to why they would be reaching out or why it was reported.

I believe this is because a member of our team was supposed to be traveling for a project to client sites over the next few months (before the delta variant pushed the travel policy a few more months but allowing voluntary travel). That person is leaving the team and to ensure that this wouldn’t necessitate me to fill in, I let my manager know months ahead that I would not be capable of that— but am perfectly capable of continuing my current role. 

He ensured me that I would not require to travel and can work with whichever member of the team will be traveling, from offsite. A couple of weeks back, I received a resourcing list where I was listed as on-site for all projects starting in September. I again checked with my manager who assured me it was just a placeholder.

Today, I received an email from HR which is almost identical to the one my coworker received suddenly when 9 months pregnant which preceded conversations with HR that offered two options:
1. Take 2 weeks of SDL and if still incapable of voluntary travel, apply for extended FMLA leave which is obviously with reduced pay.
2. Continue to travel, regardless of whether the work can be completed offsite

Now she chose to continue to travel but I really just physically cannot. I want to be prepared for this conversation so I have some questions:

1. I’m already searching for another job since clearly when the travel policy runs out, I won’t be able to meet the travel requirements of the role. But I assumed I had more time since mandatory travel was pushed out through mid-next year. Can they force me to choose between medical leave with reduced pay and traveling voluntarily?
2. Does this count as an accommodation if it doesn’t and historically hasn’t interfered with my current work, and technically the delta variant is a concern for anyone of any condition, so regardless of my mobility, can’t I refuse to travel without having to take medical leave with reduced pay?
3. Do I need to disclose the full extent of my condition? And if my managers (who have been probing myself, my coworkers and family—who they had a prior professional relationship with— for the last few months, for whatever reason) have already disclosed details that I don’t want to officially confirm till it affects my job, do I need to?
4. I should also mention I have been in PT to regain strength for a few months and have been required to leave at 5:45 PM every day for a while— but would always finish necessary work at night after my return. I used to work 12-18 hrs a day, without complaining, and always delivered nothing less than a high quality product— significantly above my colleagues within the same level— which my managers themselves confirmed earlier this year as the reason I was submitted for promotion. But 80 hour work weeks are not part of my contract and neither is overtime so can they consider my leaving work at 5:45 PM (starting at 7-9 am as necessary to complete work on time) as an accommodation or as notable “impact” on my work?

My employers have a history of retaliation (the timing of this is not coincidental) and immoral behavior to a greater degree than I’m comfortable with and do not expect them in any way to treat me differently. I am actively looking for another job but can not afford to lose income before I am able to find another opportunity.

My father died suddenly almost two months ago, and I've been working with my family on the estate. I'm going to be administrator after I finish the application + bond application (there was no will).

Last week we received a letter saying that his $380,000 mortgage has been paid to company A through a mortgage insurance policy that we didn't know he had. We were elated and relieved. I thought it was strange, though, since the only records we found were his monthly payments to company B for the mortgage. I didn't question it and thought it was paid in full.

However, this week company B is calling because they haven't received his monthly mortgage payment, and the total payoff amount is still $380,000. What's going on here?

There's no way our dad had over $700k mortgaged between two companies on a property worth much less than that. I suspect his policy wasn't updated to pay company B after he refinanced his mortgage, and just paid the old company, company A.

Looking on the county public records search, it says his mortgage is 'released'. And the letter for paid in full to company A says there are no liens on the property.

I'm trying to retain counsel, but the only person I've been able to talk to is going on vacation and hard to reach. I want her business to do the title search for me and investigate this. It's been very hard to talk to attorneys because most don't want to take our estate on, they all have told me that the assets in the estate are small and easy enough to distribute that I can do it without them. And until this happened, I was.

However I want this corrected professionally because company B won't even speak to me since I am not my dad, the owner. 

Until I can retain counsel, is there any other advice or information that can help me or to help me understand this? Thank you.",legaladvice,Mortgage insurance paid to wrong company?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7na60/mortgage_insurance_paid_to_wrong_company/

In the letter, they state the insurance company they are representing, and at this time no attorney has not evaluated or made any recommendations to the claim.  

I was still concerned that it was a scam because I was never in the city they mentioned so I looked up their law firm website and all of the letterhead information matched. They are also on the BBB website. 

I contacted my insurance agent to see if they could offer me any advice and they said there is nothing they could really do. They did however look on their database and said there was no police report for me and that no insurance claims had been made against me either.

I paid for everything myself and have the emails and bank statements proving this. I then once I was settled in got a roommate to help cover the costs and save some money. It was sub-leased through the property management office so we were both equally tenants there. 

However neither the property manager nor myself collected a security deposit from this roommate as adding the roommate was an amendment to my current lease. Moving forward to 2020 my roommate moves out with no issues and a new roommate moves in. Same thing happens, this roommate is added to the lease via amendment (and prior one removed). Now in 2021 I no longer wished to stay at this property and neither did this roommate. So we decide to end the lease and move out at the end of it. I should note here that this roommate and I had very little communication during our stay together. He was a ghost. I saw him roughly once a month to pay me utilities, maybe twice if I came home and he was in the kitchen cooking. 

In June of 2021 the property management notifies us via email that unless told otherwise they will make the security deposit check out to include both myself and this roommate, stating we will both need to be present to cash it. I email them back, CC-ing the roommate, that I am the only person who paid the security deposit and that I would like it to be made out to me alone. They say that is fine, but my roommate needs to acknowledge that they will relinquish their rights to the security deposit. My roommate doesn't reply. I text him asking him to do so and he says he didn't pay the deposit and will let the property management know. I assume it's taking care of and focus and dealing with the move and everything. 

A month goes by and the property management sends another email saying they haven't heard back from my roommate. Once again I reply and CC the roommate to do so. Nothing. I text him. No response. At this point the roommate has physically moved out of the property. At this point, the lease ends in a week. I send a another email to the property management stating my roommate isn't contacting me and I have no way to get in contact besides email or phone, and if they refuse to respond I don't see how I should be punished out of my money for this. Then the roommate responds to the email chain stating he left his key on the counter and that was it. 

Now its about 3 weeks after moveout and I haven't heard from him, I am just waiting on the check to see what I can do to get it deposited if it has his name. Yesterday I received another email from the property asking my roommate to acknowledge his names removal from the check, which their has been no reply. I sent him another text asking to respond, no response. So at this point, my mind is simply get the check and cash it. If I can't do so, take my roommate to small claims court to get the check turned over to me. 

So to sum it up, would small claims court be the best move for me to get him to revoke claim to this check he has no right to? Or should I be pressuring the property managers more to remove it.  I assume they are bound by legal requirements which is why I didn't push them very hard. Also should I do anything else before I do receive the check and take it to court? I am in Colorado if that changes the answer regarding this.

He refuses basic repairs and which has caused further damage to the home (multi unit). Very rude person, even though we have a perfect record of paying our bills on time. 

I leave the home yesterday and am stopped by the LL. He is with a contractor, I assume making repairs on behalf of the other tenants. Never seen him in person before. He tells me about a leak my downstairs neighbor is having. He then asks me to tell the neighbor that we had a big party and a keg exploded and that’s what caused the leak (We have never had a party, we are just younger than his usual tenants and thinks I’m dumb enough to take blame). Basically asked me to lie so he wouldn’t have to fix a leak. 

I am appalled and tell him he’s a dick. He then tries to fight me. I have to back up and run at one point because he was getting very aggressive and violent with his words and body language. He verbally threatens me with harm. Tells me he will “hunt me down, and find me.” He tells me to get the fuck out and don’t come back. He then added he would terminate our lease and that we need to find somewhere new to live immediately. 

I then left out of fear. I made a police report to get it on record. I am not pressing charges. I spoke with my neighbor who then spoke with him since he was there for him. My neighbor told him he was out of line making threats and said that leak was there before we even moved in and they all know that. LL told neighbor that he knows he messed up, was having a bad day bc he has to spend all this money etc.

There was an incident where the fire department was called.  Turned out to be a pan left burning on the lit stovetop.  She slept through it.  Sent a contractor out for an unrelated HVAC complaint (worked fine).  He provided photo evidence smoke detectors were unplugged.  They were connected at the time of the fire department call, as a neighbor called it in due to them going off for an extended period of time and the smell of smoke.  Management provided 24hr notice, attempted to enter next day, but the door was barricaded.  Tenant was present as they saw her in an upstairs window.  


I've since begun the application process for the City/County program for rental assistance.  I'm doubtful I recoup anything as the program requires her to provide proof of income, and attest to Covid hardship.

Upon screening, her income and employment were verified.  She works in real estate, and she's alluded in writing, that ""because of covid, I'm hoping that you can get the rent covered from the covid landlord program.""  Proves she's aware of these programs, but never attested to hardship.

Police, Sheriff, lawyers, and judges seem to be involved and I don't know where else to turn or what to do or any options at this point. I've gone through two different lawyers who say they've done all they can do and just abandoned the case and advised me to find someone else to carry it on.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story: In 2004 my uncle was named as executor of my grandparents' will, worth millions, despite being a convicted felon, because my grandmother just really trusted him that much. It was supposed to have been split equally three ways, but over the years he spent it all for himself and his drug habit. Part of the millions he got was reserved specifically for maintenance of the property and estate, and he let my grandparents' once beautiful home fall into shambles and is grossly irreparable at this point. I won a case against him in 2016 for him mismanaging and defrauding the trust, but no further action was taken.

&amp;#x200B;

In December of 2019, after pressuring my lawyer for progress on closing the estate completely and getting uncle officially off of everything and out of his control, we went to probate court. The judge gave him 10 days to be off the property or be jailed. An administrator appointed by the county was put in charge of the estate and property.

&amp;#x200B;

Many months go by of nothing happening, I keep pressuring my lawyer about taking action since uncle is still living on and continuing to whittle away at the property. We finally got another hearing late June, when the judge gave him one day to get off the property or be jailed, and not to remove anything from the property. I thought for sure he would be jailed, but no, more time and freedom. Contempt of court and defying judge's orders for a year and a half, and not even a slap on the wrist. The county-appointed administrator who was supposed to have taken control of the property reported to the judge that he had been requesting keys to the house from uncle, and uncle always replied that he would get them to him later. Why this was acceptable, I do not know. Uncle was ordered to give up the keys.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few weeks, while continuing to live on the property, he has removed everything of value from the estate. Valuable assets to the last of my family's heirlooms. I called to report this, and my lawyers said the administrator has to be the one to report it since he's in charge of it. I report this to him, and he does nothing. Days go by and finally he acknowledges that uncle is still there and he has filed a police report. Police were called later, but they wouldn't touch him because they said there was no police report and no warrant, and also his name was still on the deed to the house! It never should have been in the first place, it should have been in the name of the estate, but most certainly should have been removed from him in December of 2019 when the administrator took over. He continues to remove everything he can off the property, occasionally even while the administrator showed up and caught him doing it. Administrator always refuses to call the police, saying he doesn't want to wait around because it might take hours for them to get there. (I can't be there personally, there is someone helping me that lives closer to the area and they are limited on how much they are allowed to intervene. I live an hour and a half away, and am immunocompromised and have stayed mostly quarantined since March 2020, but am also vaccinated.) Administrator refused to communicate with me or respond to me anymore after I told him that his police report he filed didn't take and I didn't feel like he had the best interest of the estate as a priority.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, my lawyers terminated their service with me, saying there was nothing more they could do and I was free to seek another attorney if I was not satisfied. They abandoned the case, and of course I was not satisfied, and I told them I feel I had just given over the estate to the administrator who is clearly not unbiased and if not directly trying to help uncle continue to commit crimes and trespass and squat on the property, he's at least complicit and negligent. He never even took an accounting of what was on the property before allowing uncle to remove everything he wanted first. There's really no telling what was lost.

While that is annoying, I believe that people should be aloud to do whatever they want on their own property.

But their boy has become a nasty manipulative piece of work and his family's neglect leads him to go out in the street and wander around looking for people to talk to.  We tried really hard to be there for him, as we are fully aware that he is a product of his upbringing, which is not his fault.  But he ignores our daughter when she is playing in her yard and asks him to leave her alone.  He is only 6 but he is already a master manipulator (another sad fact due to his upbringing) and will pull every trick in the book to get her to keep interacting with him.  We draw the line when he starts threatening violence against her, and we go tell his parents and they bring him in.

This happens every day.  The parents do nothing to stop it until my wife or I intervene.  I am tired of having my daughter live under the threat of violence and constant manipulation from this boy.

I am going to the dealership today to insist they put me in a reliable car until mine is fixed.

We moved into this home, which seemed like a nice place when we walked through it. We signed the contract in November, which was our mistake to be honest, because my husband and I got home and talked it after without the landlord being in our faces, and decided we shouldn't have signed the contract. We hadn't moved anything into the house yet, nor had been given keys or anything. In fact it had only been about an hour since we signed the contract, at around 9PM, when we called the landlord and told him we were sorry for wasting his time but that we were deciding we would not be moving in. He told us since the contract was signed there was nothing he could do. 

We felt horrible for wasting his time and believed that yeah, because the contract was signed, there was nothing we could do. So we moved in. 

First problem was the bathtub wasn't draining. They 'fixed' that. But a week later it stopped draining again, so they had to come fix it again. Then when the weather got down to the low 30s, our heater stopped working, and it took about a week and a half for them to fix it, so we had to buy small electric heaters to keep ourselves and our 8month old baby warm. When that was fixed, we thought everything was fine. However a couple weeks later we saw a mouse. We killed it, and things were fine again. Then the fridge stopped working, and it took around 3 weeks to get it replaced. The landlord left the old fridge in our yard for around 5 months before coming to pick it up, and it made the yard look messy and crowded.

An important fact about this house is that the foundation seems off. There are holes in between the walls and the floor, there are gaps under the doors and under the windows where animals could crawl through. There are gaps between the doors and the walls too. Then there are actual holes on the floors and ceilings that we didn't see when we did the walkthrough. I know that's our fault for not examining everything, every corner of this house. I get it. But still, so after all of that, we ended up seeing a snake coming out of a hole in the wall, into our kitchen/laundry area. We had already had a lot of bugs coming in from under the doors and windows, which we told the landlord about and he told us to just buy bug spray...  but a snake?! 

So we told our landlord to please come fix these gaps under the doors and windows, and the repairman suggested that the landlord just get us new doors and align the windows correctly. The landlord refuses and just told the repairman to place wood in front of the gaps. The hole where the snake came from in the wall was sealed, but all of the other holes weren't. 

After that, we had an ant infestation. They were coming from outside, from the gaps still, even though they had that wood covering the gaps. And they were also coming from inside our vents, essentially from the basement. We had to buy more bug spray and ant spray. 

Also when I was putting dishes into our clean cabinets, I accidentally hit the cabinet and from the space between the cabinet and the wall, out came around 5 dead roaches. So my husband hit the cabinets a little harder to check it out, and around 20 dead roaches fell out from behind there. It wasn't as concerning since they were dead, but ew? A few months later we saw one alive and I was ready to move out. But we just bought more bug spray since our lease wasn't up. We haven't seen another roach (alive) since.

Then the water spout in the bathtub flew off from the wall from the water pressure. We asked to get it fixed and the repairman recommended fixing the actual pipes in the wall because the issue was that they were too old. The landlord refused and told him to simply glue it back to the wall. It fell out again, and they had to come glue it back on a second time. 

Then a storm hit, and this huge tree in our front yard was hit by lightning. The tree was cut down the middle by the lightning, and half of the tree fell over above our sidewalk and porch. The only thing keeping the tree up was another tree. It took 2.5 weeks for the landlord to get someone to get rid of it, so we would have to walk under that branch every day to leave for work or wherever.

Then our small washer/dryer appliance stopped working as well, and although they did give us new appliances, a different repairman said we would need to buy some pipes and break the wall to install them because the landlord had done it wrong in the first place. We didn't do that, as we didn't want to give the landlord a reason to say we broke the wall or anything. 

We see spiders on our bed constantly, so we have to be checking the bed everytime we lay on it. My baby has been bitten multiple times. So has my husband. I've been bitten a few times, I'm not sure if by a spider. We have centipedes as well as rollie pollies, and a bunch of other bugs that we've never even seen. We have bug spray, preventative bug spray too. We sprayed around the outside of the house and every room on the inside. The only things we don't see as much are centipedes, everything else hasn't been affected by the spray. 

We've been in this house around 8 months now and our lease isn't over until 7 months from now (he said he couldn't give us a 12 month lease). After months of not seeing a mouse, we not only saw a mouse again, but a black rat and a really big brown rat. We hear them in the ceilings and walls. There's probably other stuff I've forgotten to mention too, but alas. 

We're ready to move, but we're worried breaking our lease will get us an eviction on our record. We've taken pictures and have all of our texts with the landlord. Does anyone have any legal advice? Our landlord works for a real estate company, so it's not like HE personally owns the house, the realtor group does. Again, I know we should've taken more time to examine the house before we moved in, I get it and we've definitely learned from that.",legaladvice,"Rats, Mice, Bugs, Snakes Inside Home - Wanting to Break Lease",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7lx73/rats_mice_bugs_snakes_inside_home_wanting_to/

I live in NY and rented a car in Seattle, WA a few months back and while it was parked it received some minor damage on the front end. What I'd classify as a pretty decent scratch on the bumper. I had declined the company's coverage in favor of my insurance and my credit card's coverage.

Got back to the rental company, took pictures and parted ways. The company filed through my insurance and my insurance paid for the damages/repair (wayyyy too much for the damage in my opinion but out of my hands). However my insurance contacted me and said that the rental company was seeking Loss of Use as well as Diminished Value and Administrative fees, but my insurance doesn't pay that so the rental company will probably try to come after me.

I'm beginning to see why this was the cheapest rental option... Whoops.

Anyway, the rental company hired some claim management team, to handle all this and they sent me a letter basically telling me since they couldn't collect it from my insurance I have 30 days to dispute or pay or they'll send to to a collections agency. I looked up this claim management team and I see the specialize in bullying out these specific payments for rental car companies.

I realize I could write back to them asking for details on how these figures were settled on but that they probably aren't required to send me exact details.

 So I have two questions for r/legaladvice

1. Should the attorney I talk to about be in NY or WA?
2. In your opinion, how likely is it that it's worth my time paying an attorney to write a strongly worded letter on my behalf or should I just try to negotiate with the claim management company?

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is selling her house near a major city in California. She is a professional artist, and while living there she put a large art installation in one of the bedrooms. She is aware this may make the home slightly harder to sell since art is subjective, but she poured a lot of time and money into this art installation and would rather sell the home to someone who appreciates it, even if it means it takes slightly longer. (Which, let's be real, that means it's going to take three weeks instead of one - this is CA.) She expressed this preference very clearly to her realtor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her realtor just posted the listing for the house and in the photos, it is clear the realtor destroyed the art installation in favor of making the room more bland and broadly appealing. The realtor did not get permission to do this nor did she even tell my friend she was doing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know the details of any contractual agreement my friend has with her realtor, but she's not especially legally savvy so we can safely assume it's whatever is most standard in CA.   


Were the realtor's actions here illegal? Does my friend have a case to sue civilly for the damage to the house? (If my friend were paid to create a similar installation in someone else's house, the cost would easily be in the five figures.) Is there a potential criminal complaint here?

i also never got all of my stuff that was in my totaled car back and they sold it to a junkyard, so i have to buy new stuff out of my own pocket which is not only unfair to me but i literally can’t afford to be buying replacements for all the stuff that was taken from me.

I will get straight to the point. I am a disabled vet (60% rated from the VA) None of this affects any ability to do my job at my current employer.

Back in march on my lunch break I went outside to play some B-Ball on the company provided court on their property on my lunch break. Soon as started dribbling the other guy smacked my hand then it through my arm back and dislocated my shoulder. That day I left and went to the VA to get treated and they said I needed to see ortho. I started having pain from my shoulder to my hand and it was affecting my ability to work. 

I went and told my SUP after having to miss a couple days due to this that he said I need to go on FMLA. Fmla with my company is handled outside with a different company because of my current employers size. The FMLA was approved in May, and I was given up to 12 weeks. Now since covid is going on the amount of time it took to get into appointments has been so bad. I had PT appointments, appointment for the MRI and then just waiting to get into the ortho clinic at the VA took time. All this time pretty much burned my FMLA and my doctor would not release me to go back because I needed time to rest the arm. 

I tried explaining this situation to the employer and they didnt care. So my FMLA expired in august just as I got a call from the ORTHO clinic to get my surgery finally. Once I saw ortho initially I was told I would have to wait 2 weeks to get on the schedule. It ended up being almost a month to get on the schedule and I didnt even get to see my surgeon at this appt, they said I would see him day of surgery and that because of covid only 2 surgeons are doing knees, shoulders, etc (sports ortho). Once my FMLA time expired I tried to file a extension but it got denied. 

&amp;#x200B;

The company that manages the leave for our company did send another form of Leave and its under the ADA. I had that filled out by my doctor that has been filling all FMLA paperwork and it was submitted to this company before FMLA expired. Now Im currently in limbo. Basically this ADA leave is from when FMLA expires till 6 weeks (to recover from surgery). My boss has texted me here and there asking if Ive heard from the company and I said no new updates. So the other day I had asked him if he heard anything and he said its with our employers attorney and the leave company.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I asked again if he had any updates on our side with HR or anything, and he called me and said if its with the company attorney he is going to say no its more than likely not going to get approved and you will end up getting terminated. He then asked me that I might need ""to start thinking about a resignation of I wanna resign"" rather than taking the termination on my record for future employment. Do I have any kind of law suit here? Ive reached out to a couple attorneys and Im waiting for a call back, in the mean time Im asking for help here to get some opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

All because of covid is the reason this whole situation happened with me having to burn time etc waiting for appointments.

My roommates and I moved into a new rental house a little over two months ago. Immediately upon moving in we gave notice to the landlord of several problems including leaks in the basement where one of the rooms is located.

The landlord was initially receptive and said he would have someone take a look at it. A month later a contractor (unsure if he is legit, seems like a random guy) comes, confirms what we saw with the leaks and then another month after that finally comes in and starts ripping up wall and floor. Surprise, surprise, there is mold.

We (tenets) call in a mold testing unit to find out if it is dangerous. Today they get back to us with results that it is dangerous, contains black mold and the air is potentially harmful.

Now we are discussing with the landlord. He is supposedly going to remediate the mold (no clue how long that will take). We really just want to break the lease and get out, but the landlord thinks because he is fixing it we can’t do that. 

What are our options here? At minimum we expect he needs to provide alternative housing and some sort of reimbursement but really we just want to be out.

Hey reddit i need advice on an ongoing situation involving two parties and a dog. The story includes a father and son whom i will name shit (S) and little shit (LS) aged (16) and my girlfriend and her family (her(16), her mum and her younger sister (11) and obviously the dog (D) a whippet greyhound cross.

A little backstory:
D was rescued by S and LS when she was a puppy. They had her for around a year in which they had her microchipped in their name. S then went to prison. D was given to my GF and her family as the families were longtime friends.
My GF's family has had her for around 3 years and have payed for everything (food, vets, ect.)
D loves the family and seems very happy. LS has been allowed to come and see her and take her on walks so long as he brings her back. D loves to see him although he takes her illegally rabbit and deer hunting and has admitted to hitting her as some sort of ""discipline"". One time LS took her to show off to his mates and ended up making her jump a razor wire fence and she cut her leg very badly, At this time S was recently released from prison, we were all afraid she would need her leg amputated as it was so bad! She luckily kept her leg but needed stitches and medication (shes fine now apart from a large scar) My GF's mum was forced to pay for everything as S refused. For the  full 3 years they have had D, LS has been adimant that she was still his dog (shes not!).

Okay so onto whats currently happening:
LS came to see her and take her out , once he had left he told my GF's mum that she would be spending the night with him , something nobody was happy about, but she agreed believing he would bring her back the next day. By the end of the next day she still hadnt been brought home.
We tried to get in contact with him or S but we couldn't. By the end of the third day we got into contact with S and he said to call him agian tommorow to talk about it and work out getting the dog home. Today is the 4th day and everyone has been blocked on everything by S and LS. My GF's mum made a Facebook post and tagged LS in it letting everyone know D was not his and he had no right to take her. To this he commented and said she was in fact his and we would not be getting her back. My GF and her younger sister are distraught and my GF has been crying and messaging him pleading for D back and he has said no.

Is there anything we can do get the dog back.
I have googled the microchip and it says it does not prove legal ownership and i believe that he will mistreat and endanger her.

I read this online but it was an older article, I’m not sure of it’s accuracy Please read below-

“It’s easy for employers to run afoul of the notice regulation. In most cases, unless the employer gives appropriate notice within two business days after the employee’s leave begins, the designation is not retroactive. Thus, if Human Resources (or whoever else is responsible for giving notice at a particular employer) is not informed of a FMLA-qualifying leave until a number of days or weeks after it has begun – and, therefore, gives a late designation notice – the employee’s FMLA rights will extend beyond the 12 weeks of leave required by the statute.

For example, if the employer does not give the designation notice until the employee has been gone for two weeks, the DOL regulations say that the 12-week period did not start running until the notice was given. The result, in this example, is that the employee can be on a leave protected by the FMLA for 14 weeks, rather than 12 weeks. (Before the designation notice is given, the employee still gets all the protections of the FMLA, but the employer may not count the time against the 12-week annual total.) “

In my case my last day worked was 6/15. I used vacation time 6/9-6/14 and came to work on the 15th. On the 15th my doctor gave me a medical leave note backdated to the 9th. As far as I understand, FMLA is dependent on when I received an approval for FMLA from my employer. 

Can anybody elaborate on the rules? My employer is trying to say my FMLA started as of 6/9  even though I requested vacation days off because I didn’t have a doctors note until the end of the day on 6/15.

The house was literally sold and they took it the next day i moved out; i verified as i had to go back for new mail, so i know my deposit was not used on the room or house.

So how do i sue for my deposit back? I have their first and last name, email, paypal and have sent money to their bank, but I lack their physical address. I read I need to serve the papers preferably through certified mail to them, but the only way i can contact them is text. I think i found their Linkedin (no pic but unique name) but id rather not show up at their work if possible.

As far as the argument goes - we've communicated through text for half a year and only met 2 times but when i asked for deposit back (through text) he said he thought he gave me cash and is now ignoring me. I'm able to ""search"" his name in my bank and it shows every one of my payments to him, but conveniently for him hes saying he paid me in cash (which is a full ass lie, we barely talked; i know he knows he didnt pay me and is trying to just ignore the problem). 

Is this an easy case win if I bring my phone with texts showing i agreed to a security deposit id get back, as well as a printed screenshot of my bank transactions searching his name? No lease was signed, all the agreements were done through text.

Around a year ago, she told me how she had started feeling suicidal. While I've been around her as much as possible trying to help, her condition has deteriorated vastly.

Recently, she's been throwing these rage fits where she's thrashing around and punching violently. In one of these incidents, she also hurt me physically. She speaks about killing herself everyday, and I have no idea what to do.

Coming to why she's suicidal, she believes that there's no spark in the relationship anymore. She thinks that I'm not attracted to her anymore, although I've never said or done anything to make her feel that way. We also never had any major relationship problems. Basically, this just started out of the blue. The situation is so bad now that I've to force myself to be very sexually active with her whenever we meet, because if I'm not, she takes it as a sign of rejection and throws a rage fit.

I have recently connected with her parents and informed them about everything that is happening. While they're very concerned and overwhelmed, they haven't taken a single step to protect her. I've also spoken to her brother, who thinks that she's being extremely manipulative and that I should cut her off immediately. Her family dynamic is not the healthiest.

Another problem is that she's extremely private, and has not confided in anyone about anything. Everything is bottled up. She has no idea that I've spoken to her parents and a couple of her friends. If she finds out about this, I'm worried it'll push her over the edge. 

While I've constantly ignored all of the red flags, and looked for signs that we can make this relationship work, I've come to realise that that's not possible. My mental health has taken a beating, and I see no way out of this cycle of despair. I think I gave up the day she got upset and angry that I was leaving her to meet family (after a year).

As of now, I'm trying to distance myself in a way that she's protected from harm, and I'm protected in case the worst happens. To this end, I'm speaking to a lawyer who's asked me to file a police complaint, after which I'm supposed to break up with her (and alert her parents and Suicide Watch before doing so).

I'm not sure if filing a complaint is the right thing to do, but the lawyer insists that its necessary to protect myself legally in case something happens. I would much appreciate anyone here sharing advice if they've been in a similar situation before.

The phone was advertised as mint condition, unlocked, fully paid off, and ready to use. They even put up the phone's unique IMEI (serial number) to make sure the phone is not blocked.

Is there a way a minor can be emancipated with only one parent's consent and not both?

Please let me know if this sort of post isn't allowed here and if someone could please point me in the right direction to the right subreddit or some sort of resource for this question.

My family is going through a crisis where the short is that:

My mom and her husband (who is a lawyer) are abusive emotionally (possibly physically though they leave no evidence) to my brother, she's also rich so she pretty much does whatever she wants with custody (of which she has ""half"" custody and my dad has NO parenting time, so essentially she has non official full custody) and courts don't care about abuse unless there's physical evidence. They have the time, money, and knowledge about how to skirt the laws.

My dad is not rich and is, well, a dad and not a mom, so automatically courts don't give a shit about his side of things. He does not have the time and money to figure this shit out.

My brother is 17 and literally a few months away from becoming 18, yet courts dont give a shit about what he wants which is to stay at our dad's and stop being abused by our mom and her husband

The therapist that our mom forced him to see was absolutely crooked and she just payed him off to make her look good in court and didnt give shit about my brother's well-being

So my brother is DESPERATELY seeking a way to become emancipated so he can stay at our dad's and so our mom will leave him alone. The only way he thinks this can happen is to temporarily get married. There's gotta be some way for him to get away from our mom that doesn't involve that. It's ridiculous that laws can uphold something like that but a minor that's ALMOST a legal adult can't get a PPO or restraining order or something of his own accord without having to have an abusive parent's permission.

We are “sister neighborhoods” with another neighborhood. The builder put a community pool in our neighborhood to share between both ‘hoods. Recently, we have learned that non-residents have been breaking in to our pool after hours. We have reached out to our HOA (mis)management company, and essentially were told they would not put in better locks to keep people out, and that if anything were to happen, the homeowners would be liable, instead of the HOA. Is it possible for us to be held responsible for this just because we are the homeowners? Or is this something that should fall on the HOA? We pay our quarterly dues, and have pleaded with them to put up security measures (signage, cameras, etc) and their response is “you can do whatever you want when you control the HOA.” How can this be our liability?

I lived in my apartment for 3 years and left at the end of January to move in with my girlfriend.  While living in my old building, I was a model tenant.  I worked nights, slept most of the day, made zero noise, had no pets, and can literally count on one hand the number of guests I had the entire time I lived there.  I made zero alterations to the apartment and didn't damage anything.  I paid the rent in full on time every month, including during the pandemic.

So I was moving out on January 31st of this year.  Obviously the rent was paid for January.  There ended up being heavy snowfall that day and moving two apartments ended up taking all day.  We finally finished near midnight on the 31st and the landlord was not available to take my keys.  I texted him the next day and he still wasn't available, so I dropped the keys in the mailbox where the rent checks go.  The next day I texted and he confirmed he recieved the key.

So began a 6 month game of phone tag to get my security deposit back.  He was a good landlord (albeit one whose services I never required) and I'm not super hard up for money so I was patient.  Never did it occur to me that he was trying to screw me over.  The total amount is $1800.  I finally got tired of waiting this week and called over and over until he could no longer make excuses not to talk.  He told me because he didn't recieve the keys until the 2nd, I was forfeiting the entire deposit.  I was flabbergasted.  Even if he wants to lie and say he had to have a new key made, that's a couple hundred bucks, not almost two grand.  Obviously I was livid and he said he would see what he could do and call me back.  I'm not sure what that means since AFAIK he is the sole owner of the building.  Fast forward two days and he still hasn't called me, so I call him back.  He tells me half ($900) is the best that he can do.  He and his two partners have to agree unanimously and he and one guy said half and the third guy said nothing.  This is the first I'm hearing of his two partners.  I tell him I'm gonna be forced to take him to small claims court and he tells me to do what I have to do, that two others have tried and lost.

I think he's banking on me being too lazy to go to court and I'll just accept the $900 pittance.  I've done basic research and it seems like the only thing he can deny returning the money for is damage or unpaid rent, of which there is neither.

I plan to try and arrange one in person meeting with him to try and reason with him, but if that fails I'm taking him to court (hopefully armed with some advice from here.)  I do still have the text from the first telling him I dropped off the key, but everything else is my word against his.

I also had/have massive school debt (roughly 100 grand divided between federal and private loans), so around 2017 I prioritized those bills which I could not forego easily, as a result I fell behind on Barclay. I naturally tried working with all entities involved before I ultimately ignored them. Apparently missing one payment is enough to slap on a 37% interest rate non-negotiable, so, in my anger, I was non-negotiable as well (I stopped paying/communicating immediately).  

Fast forward to 2021, and I am being pursued by various collection agencies, all of whom I ignore at this point. As of 2020-present I am unemployed and receiving benefits, which expire in 2-ish weeks. Barclay or whoever they sold debt to I believe is just the first of several collection agencies getting ready to sue my ass.

Naturally I am quite nervous, so any and all help is greatly appreciated. Apologies if I went on a little there, I have also uploaded the letters I received from said collection agency/court about being sued. Thank you again.

I left my car with my friends (same apartment complex) while I was overseas and they informed me that my car was stolen. My car wasn’t under insurance when it was stolen.

This happened in early July, but the car might have actually been stolen in late June.

They helped me file a police report as I was still overseas at the time, but now that I’m back (Arizona), I found out that the car was found in Las Vegas and reported as an abandoned car. I called the towing company but was told that it was picked up on the same day it was towed by “the person who owns the title”.

I don’t remember clearly because I was overseas for a pretty long time, but I’m pretty sure I left the car title in the car as well..

At this point, I don’t know

* If I should inform the DMV or the police (or both) that my car title was stolen, or can I just ask for a new car title, and would that automatically inform the DMV that my car title was stolen?
   * and if I do inform the police, do I inform the AZ police or LV police?
* If I should or need to get rid of the car registered under my name in the DMZ (because I honestly don’t see myself getting the car back)
   * the DMV said that to get rid of the car under my name I can submit a sold notice, but that requires a name and contact that I sold the car to, which I obviously don’t have.
* If it would be easier to just get a new car, or if I should continue pursuing this matter.
   * because I'm not even sure if I want the car back anymore at this point in time

This all happened in June of last year. I've been sitting on this as I worry about trying to find a new job. My dad has been paying my rent for a year and he says times up. I've frankly been worried about how to find a lawyer I can't afford.

I am unaware of how exactly the PPP program from last year works, but if I understand it correctly, the money is supposed to go to the employees. My boss stole money out of mine and all the other workers paychecks and then he HELPFULLY explained in detail why he had to because ""he's the owner and needs it more"" and ""there's no such thing as free money. Why do you deserve it if you didn't work for it?"" and so on. I have a recording of him explaining that he did it and rationalizing why, which I assume is actionable in court.

Then he refused to pay me for an entire month of work, which I can prove I did because I recorded from the time I walked into the business from the time I clocked out, I kept my phone on and recording. I worked 8 hour shifts totaling over 90 hours. All of which I didn't get paid for when I mentioned that he stole money from me. He yells at me to get the hell out and I wasn't paid.

Oh and he also sexually harassed me while I worked for him by slapping my ass and grinding himself on me and pinching my nipples.

My question is: What do I have? Can I take him to court? Does he lose the business? Will he have to pay the loan back to the government?

Naturally, she had them taken away due to her addiction and when she passed, they were given to a  woman in the town. My GF grew up with this woman and knows she is not the best person herself and feel like she adopted the kids to simply collect a check from the state.   


Since then, the caregiver has made it *impossible* for my wife and her family to even visit the children under the guise of 'it will damage them to associate with their addict mother'.  


Meanwhile, *everybody* else in the family is normal, employed, healthy, and upstanding citizens with no physical or substance abuse issues; they are a perfectly loving family and want nothing more than to see the children and be in their lives.   


Recently, the daughter (teenager) reached out and said she left the caregiver's home because she didn't want to be there and left her brother (9) there to fend for himself. This is obviously a huge red flag and validates the family's suspicions.   


However, in typical small town fashion, the caregiver has friends and connections with CPS so this all gets swept under the rug while the caregiver continues to drag the mother's name through the mud. Appealing at the local level seems to be out of the question.

So basically, me and my current roommate were looking to really quickly move to a new apartment since we both got new jobs at the same time. We found a really nice place owned by a local property company that had everything we wanted. Basement, gas stove, central AC, accepted cats, etc. Our first tour of the house showed no problems so we decided to sign the lease. I even looked up reviews of the company and looked up any cases they had in the local court system to see if anything suspicious showed up and everything looked fine. 

However, for the pre-move in  inspection me and my roommate noticed a lot of flies and a weird smell in the kitchen. The realtor insisted it was because the matinence people had to keep the doors open a lot to put new appliances in. Next day,, Aug 1st, we're moving all our stuff in and the smell is worse. We move the stove from the wall and discover that the gas line valve has been put behind the wall and that the giant hole left in the wall from installing said gas line has been left open and there is a TON of rat poop. We look in the basement below where the stove is and see a bunch of rat poop there too, and rat holes in the ceiling. Also found three different rat holes behind the AC unit outside, and none of the pilot lights on the stove worked. I instantly contact property management about the infestation and me and my roommate decide to stay with relatives until the issues are solved. 

It took management TWO AND A HALF WEEKS to fix everything. Me and my roommate demanded compensation for not being able to live in our own apartment and threatened rent escrow if we didn't get anything. Literally called and emailed management every day. Management finally agreed to give us around 3/5ths credit on the total cost of next month's rent. Fast forward to last Saturday. All the rat holes outside have been filled with cement and the stove has been replaced so we figured it's safe to move in. NOPE. Matinence left all the rat poop where it was so me and my roommate had to clean everything ourselves. While we were cleaning the basement, we even found discarded potato chips and moldy chicken bones hidden away (prob also left by matinence). And then Sunday night I was sitting on our living room couch and started itching like crazy. Went to an urgent care and it now turns out we have rat mites left behind by the rats. So now we have to throw away any fabric furniture we have in the living room bc the mites are so bad in that area.

My question is, since management already agreed to compensate us for the rat problem, can me and my roommate also get them to compensate us for our furniture that we have to throw away or my urgent care bill because of the mites? We've only been able to live in this apartment for 5 days of this whole month because of all these problems, and I feel like I'm going insane having to deal with all this shit. I've also been getting onto management about them putting the gas valve behind a wall, since that's a housing code violation where we live, and they don't seem to care. Me and my roommate scheduled an appt for a housing dept inspector to come look at the place on Monday. I've gone over a ton of tenant protection laws for my state already but my brain is about to break trying to make sense of a lot of it. Any legal help in this situation  would be much appreciated thx

TLDR; we tour apartment, property management insists it's fine and up to code, we move in, discover massive rat problem, cant even live at apartment for half the month bc of said rat problem, we move back in when management insists everything is solved, eberything is not actually solved and now we have a rat mite problem and have to throw away half our furniture and are wondering if we can demand compensation for it",legaladvice,Can I demand compensation from my landlord after my furniture got infested with rats and rat mites?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7jwxn/can_i_demand_compensation_from_my_landlord_after/

I just want to know if it is legal to film a walkthrough inspection of my apartment unit.

For context, my apartment front office is on some bs these days. We think they are looking for reasons to kick us out because we have been outspoken about their slummy ways. More specifically, we think they will try to evict us on cleanliness. That is ironic because I have email documentation of us complaining about the apartment complex being squalid from day one. And I guarantee any tenant would back us up on that. About our unit, the cleanliness is hardly even an issue.

Something I read said that if they don't want to be filmed, they can choose to end the walk-through. Because wouldn't it be within my rights to have proof of the condition of my unit?

So my family member, she works in healthcare and has taken out loans against her retirement plan 403b before. The most recent one she took out was paid out to her a while back but the company she works for never processed the repayments which are supposed to come out of her paycheck. As a result the loan defaulted and the irs is now trying to collect the tax on it, as it is deemed extra income by them. I'm guessing since there were never any repayments set up to prove it's not extra income? Again I don't know very much about such things.

She was never notified by the bank that her company uses for the 403b loan, no letter saying it was in default or failure to make payments, nothing. 

When asking the company she works how this could have happened they said the person that was supposed to set up the repayments no longer works there and they don't know what to tell her, including why the repayments were never set up. It's a big hospital group that's pretty well known in the area. 

Worth mentioning that this is a smaller loan that is being referenced, she has a bigger one out from before this one she's still making payments on with the same bank and through the same company. She had thought she was making payments on both this whole time out of her paycheck until she got a bill from the irs asking for several thousand dollars.

Is there anything she can do legally or otherwise? 

From my understanding It's not like she could have set up payments herself to come out of her paycheck as it's through the company she works for. Now she's on the hook for money that wouldn't be an issue if it had been coming out of her paycheck all along just like her other loan.

WARNING THIS IS A BIT LONG, SORRY.

TL;DR Amazon has owed m 390$ for some gig work i did for them in July so about 5 weeks and they just keep telling me ""they are working on the issue"" This put me even further behind on bills than I was. I dont know what else to do.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any advice here would be super helpful. I'm not completely sure what to do at this point.

Little back story, I am a gig worker. I do them all, Uber, Uber eats, Lyft, Grub hub, DD you get the idea. 

So last month things were getting slow with all the companies in general, I was beginning to fall a bit behind on bills. So I seen a thing for Amazon Flex. Delivering packages with your own vehicle. Sign up, pick a block to work from the options they give, for example, $80 for a route that will take about 4 hours. 

Fair enough, i signed up and soon was delivering for amazon in the afternoons and normally i would be done before my allotted time and would just do my regular Uber eats or whatever for the rest of the day.

They pay out twice a week, Tuesdays and Fridays. So first payday comes and i get an email saying my banking information isn't correct.  ""hmmm, thats odd"" i thought. But i must have punched in something wrong. Turns out I did, I put my savings account number instead of my checking, and marked it as my checking account. Crap, ok, I went and changed it, my checking account number and marked it as checking. Double checking the numbers as well cus i don't want to miss next payday. Id also just like to add that my bank called to notify me they denied the deposit because it was marked as checking but was my savings account. So my bank did get it, they just denied it.

Next payday, same email, there's a problem with your banking information please check to make sure its correct. This time i called support, but of course amazon flex phone support doesn't have ""clearance"" to deal with payment issues. The only people who do? An email address. No number, no live person. 

So I email the address and check my account numbers, they are correct. I go to my bank to double check with the teller. Everything is correct. Also, all my other gigs use this account to direct deposit with no problem. 

I get an email back at 2AM, with what looks like a copy an paste list of things to do. Check your account number, is your name spelled right, that sort of basic stuff ive done already. I email them back when i get up. I get an email back at 2AM again. Im assuming it is because they are on the other side of the planet, because they only respond in the middle of the night. 

They say ok, thanks for updating, everything should be fine, give us 3-5 business days to confirm your account then we will automatically try to re deposit your earnings.   


Next pay day, same email. At this point im furious, ive worked 5 blocks and they owe me $390. I emailed the useless payment issue email address. Only to get a different rep tell me the same thing, to make sure my info is correct. 

So the next morning i called the regular number and i demanded they help me. The woman told me to  email them again, but in the email tell them my issue is not being resolved and needs to be escalated. I do this for a few days and get no response. Finally when i do get a response its a different rep telling me to make sure my account number is correct and completely ignored anything i said about escalating or that ive done that 3 times already.

So i call the regular number for a 3rd time again demanding help. This is 3 weeks into them oweing me $390. This time the woman was very helpful, gathered all my previous emails and said she would be passing this along to her supervisor and i would hear back the same day or the next. 

The next day i get a call from the escalation team! Finally, some help! Right? She asked me all the normal questions went over my numbers, how much they owed me and said she is passing it along to the right people in the escalation team and i will be hearing from them soon. Silence for a week.

Monday I get an email from the same person saying they are ""working on it"" an i will hear from them soon. Next day i get an email from a diff person in the escalation team saying the same thing, a few hours later same email, from a diff person in the escalation team, im like wtf is happening?

I wrote back saying this is obsurd. It has now been 5 weeks and I have not been paid. I started this cus i was falling behind, now im even farther behind cus all i did was spend time and gas money delivering for you guys and not getting paid! She responded saying the same thing, that she understand and that they are working on it. 

What do I do? This is ridiculous, I can send $390 to anyone in the world in 10 seconds with todays tech. The biggest company in the world cant figure out how to get me the money they owe me? Do i call the BBB? Threaten to sue them for all the late fees and just overall stress this has caused me? I mean im a gig worker with 2 kids, i live day to day basically. Losing that much time and money for no reason while already starting to fall behind really hurt. 

If you made it through this, thanks for reading. I actually kinda feel a bit better now lol

I also have sub-lessors who rent from me and I collect rent from them and pay the landlord.  Landlord tacks on a $50 per person charge as a ""service fee"" which includes minor cleaning, tea/ water service, and high speed internet.   For the past 2 months the internet has not been working and myself along with other businesses in the building have repeatedly reported this to the landlord who responded that he was ""working on it"" with the service provider and that he apologizes for the inconvenience.  

He did not seem to take action immediately upon learning about the problem, and even went on vacation for 2 weeks while this was going on, leaving me and my other renters without internet service which led to the loss of some clients since much of our business is conducted online bc of the pandemic.   I didn't lose any business during this time because I upgraded to an unlimited data plan and used my mobile hotspot while in the office, but not everyone in the office was able to do that, and regardless we are paying a monthly ""service fee"" which is supposed to include internet.   This had been going on so long I called him to find out what exactly is the problem and to ask if he needs help finding an IT professional.  He said yes so I found one for him.  The IT person came out and worked on the network, but they ultimately discovered that the problem was bad wiring in the building and it got fixed.  

My question is- what is the legal responsibility of the landlord in this situation?   I have suggested to him that I will not pay for the service fee this month because the services outlined in the agreement were not fully provided.  He responded that ""money is tight"" and he will discount my service fee if the internet service provider discounts his fee as well.  But he has not prioritized calling them and asking/ demanding for a refund or discount due to the service not being provided.   I think this is obviously shitty on his part but is it illegal?

We used it basically only to go to and from work and grocery shopping (all in the same vicinity) and to occasionally drive my other uncle to his work place an hour away.

A month and a half later the car sounds awful and we take it to a mechanic and they say its going to cost $2000 in repairs since there was a bunch of issues with it.

I retained him from California to deal with family trust issues following the death of my Mom's second husband (trust is in her name only).  I am estranged (by my choice) from my family; so retained legal counsel to deal with the family trust issues. 

Facts:  I signed a retainer agreement and paid a retainer earlier this year.  I usually receive a monthly statement showing legal fees against the retainer balance.  At present, there is approximately $450 left in the retainer.  However, I have not received an August statement.  

In the meantime, I have sent three different emails addressing three different issues to the attorney -- with no response for over six weeks now.  A few weeks ago, I called his office and spoke with his assistant, who has been really helpful.  She is sending various papers and personal property that have been brought to their office by family members.  I specifically told her that I was awaiting replies to my emails to the lawyer.  She told me she would talk to him about it.  I still haven't received any reply to my emails to him.  

Today, I received an email from the assistant asking a question about sending some additional personal property.  She also requested that I replenish the retainer with an additional $300.  I am very confused because I have previously addressed her question by email.  I suppose I can reiterate what I have already told her; but it seems so odd to me that she would send me an email asking me about something I've already addressed.  

It also seems really odd to me that I am being asked to replenish the retainer when there is still a $450 balance.  There isn't anything significant going on in the matter besides sending me documents and personal property.  

I am really put-off being asked to send additional funds when the lawyer is not responding to my questions.  (One of the questions has to do with the lack of a basic exhibit to the original trust document stating what assets and personal property the trust holds.  The missing exhibit seems basic to the trust itself; but since the lawyer doesn't respond to my emails, it's difficult to assess this issue.)  

I want to be professional about this, but am feeling really annoyed because of the lack of communication from the lawyer to my emails -- and now being asked to replenish the retainer when there are still funds in the retainer.  I don't have a problem sending additional funds; but it seems really strange to me that I am being asked to do so when there is a retainer balance at this point.  

I would love some feedback or advice how to handle this with the lawyer.  I get that he is busy and has a caseload--that is why I reached out to his assistant.  Notwithstanding, he still hasn't answered my emails.   I really feel that I have been clear in my communication and been patient.

I had two friends/witnesses who came to my apartment to get him to leave after he refused. He repeatedly slammed my head on his penis without asking for consent, rubbed the tip of his penis on my vagina after he took off my underwear, and laid on top of me asking over and over and over again if he could sleep with me. I kept shaking my head and saying, ""I can't."" At one point I went to my room to calm myself down and he came in and repeatedly asked over and over if I would suck him off, then he slammed my head on him again and had his phone pointed towards me, as if to film it.

For clarification: this all happened after smoking two bowls of marijuana. At one point I didn't want to smoke anymore but he was making me take hits even after I shook my head, and I felt pressured to. He kept saying, ""We gotta get you high.""

After the incident, I wanted to pretend it was all in my head like he said, and I fell down a terrible rabbit hole of becoming his f\*\*\* buddy. I wanted to believe it was a misunderstanding, but I know it was not. He knew what he was doing and he enjoyed being in control of me. I believe he uses drugs and alcohol to abuse women regularly.

 He abused, assaulted, and crossed my boundaries many more times, and especially if I was high or drunk, but I can only report the initial event because I have witnesses who saw him there/spoke to him.

I'm concerned there is no hope for justice, though, because of the fact that I continued to hook up with him after for a while.

She asked for her security deposit, last month's rent, and August's rent back (amounting to $2500), and we've been in constant communication with her and the landlord in trying to get that back to her. He hasn't been responsive, which we've explained to her; she's since moved out and she and her family have refused to return the keys to the apt until they've received the full amount, regardless of the fact that none of us will be able to get any of our money back until the landlord responds.

She and her parents have continuously behaved as if we were purposefully withholding the $2500, even going so far as to ambush us at the apt and demand it back in exchange for the keys. We offered to dip into our personal accounts, the money we earned by working, to return to her $1500 (equivalent to security deposit and last month's rent) in exchange for the keys, but explained that was all we were capable of giving her while still being able to afford housing ourselves. Instead, she stated that how we got the money was none of her concern, and asked for the full amount of $2500 back in the moment, which doesn't exist, literally, because we haven't gotten that amount back from the apartment complex, and neither us or our families can afford to just hand over $2500 from our own funds. At this point, because she still has the keys, we've asked our property manager to change the locks, the offer to give her $1500 in exchange for the keys still stands (we'll be there to make the exchange regardless of if she decides to show up) and we're wondering what actions we can take moving forward. To be clear, we haven't tried to withhold the money from her, and we agree that it's rightfully hers; we just can't get it her right now due to factors outside our control.

I rented a townhome in Chicago suburbs starting early 2020 and renewed it for another year early 2021. We recently bought a house which we really like and hence we have to break our current rental lease which has no early termination clause mentioned and six months remaining. When I checked with his agent before signing the current lease,he said it will be as per mutual agreement with owner, I thought it to be ok because owner seemed to be nice guy. We gave two months notice to landlord and he got his next tenant as well at a higher rent and 2 year lease.

Now 2 weeks before we plan to move out, he has sent me following estimate as my responsibility :-
- Finder's feee equivalent to one month of future rent which is 15% higher than what I am paying right now. This is when I earlier offered him to help rent out his property for no cost to him using my agent,which he denied.
- first week rent of the next month even when I am vacating the property one week earlier than what I already paid for. He was informed of our last date well in advance.
-  And to top it all, he has sent me a ball park estimate of things to make the unit ready for next tenant amounting to more than twice of my deposit with him and he is expecting me to share 50% of cost to end this lease amicably. List of maintenance items includes things like repainting, it was freshly painted when I moved in 18 months back. In my view it just needs retouch or a single coat on walls only ,not ceiling. He has included torn bug screens, loose bathroom towel rods, vent cleaning, portion of kitchen wooden backsplash replacement etc, changing bulbs. All of this appears regular wear and tear to me but still I was ok with losing half of my deposit but losing full deposit and paying few hundreds on top of it seems unreasonable to me. Even the maintenance bill looks highly inflated to me considering its just a 2 bedroom 1300sft townhome which was overhauled before I moved in. 

What are my options here?
I am thinking to offer him 75% of my deposit and pay the lenders fee to close all of this now.
Don't pay anything now and ask him to send me an invoice and dispute later in small claims court. Do I stand a chance to gain anything here considering I have broken a lease?

I got rear-ended during rush hour on a jam-packed interstate. Traffic came to a crawl, I applied my brakes but the car behind me didn't get the memo. I got hit, their radiator exploded and the drove another 500 feet before fleeing. Police report was filed first, and then I contacted my insurance immediately afterword. 


Some factors that play a part: 

the car was not insured. I don't have a dash cam and it was not safe for me to take my phone out to get a picture of the driver, and I wasn't paying full attention to my rear-view mirror to see the drivers face. The car is registered to two people, and it was NOT registered stolen. Two witnesses (including one other person who called it in) have stepped forward to identify the driver. Although my car still ran and drove, there is significant damage to the exhaust that didn't allow me to drive it, and I had to get a tow. I have full coverage on the car so that was taken care of without a problem.


The questions: 

I'm in limbo right now, as I have a claims case open with my insurance but have not proceeded. I wanted to make sure I was home and had a chance to settle down before making serious financial choices. My car isn't worth a whole lot, and there is a chance that it does get branded as totalled. They gave me the option to cash out or pay the deductible to get the car repaired. I want to make it clear that I'm not trying to pull one over on the insurance agency, nor do I want to be spiteful with special interest in mind, but is there anything I should be educated in that my insurance company might try to keep me in the dark about? What are good questions/points to bring up when speaking with the adjuster? 


The police officer who responded to my call spoke to the witnesses and ran the registration on the car that fled. The officer gave me the contact information for both witnesses as well as the names of the people whom the fleeing car was registered to.  Do I have any legal obligation to disclose the witness information as well as the information of the registered owners of the fleeing car? I ask this because I'm assuming the person who his me, having no auto insurance, also probably can't afford to be sued. At this time I have no plans to press charges as long as insurance takes care of me, but my insurance company is going to want their money and will most likely sue the suspect for the damages. If insurance does sue the suspect, would I be entitled to any compensation if/when a settlement is reached?


Do I have the right to choose which mechanic I take my car to? Last thing I want is for my car to be worse off than before the accident.

However, in the last few weeks my freezer has gone funny. Everyone online and from 3 appliance repair companies says ideally it should be 0 degrees Fahrenheit. But there's no hard line about it being between 0 and 32 that I can find. The closer to 32, the faster the food degrades, the slower it freezes, etc etc. But it's technically still ""frozen"". The two fun kickers? First, fridges won't make ice if it's above 10 degrees - so I'm getting very sporadic amounts of ice. Second, the fridge is supposed to be around 36 degrees. So it's OK for the freezer to only be 4 degrees cooler then the fridge?      

My freezer is jumping rapidly between 0 and 20 degrees throughout the day. This morning it was 20 when I first opened it - obviously it's not keeping cold the way it should and used to... but as far as I can see, it hasn't gone above 32. I've put in maintenence requests to get it checked, and they keep telling me as long as it's below 32 it's fine. I told them the ice problem, which they told me it isn't related to the temperature (check anything you like, that's a lie).  

I'm not sure if they are ignoring a safety issue and repair laws, or not. When I brought up having checked with appliance companies about temperature and ice and such, I got the line ""our maintenence has certifications, and we don't care what outside companies say"". (They f'ed up installing a dishwasher when mine broke, luckily my boyfriend - an appliance repair tech of over a decade - went to fix a screw, and realized they did the electrical 100% wrong and tried to make things very bad - he fixed it. They also took months to fix a tub leak, and finally outsourced it). I don't really trust their certifications. I'm worried I'm not noticing the temperature going even warmer. I'm also worried that I now can't trust my food in the freezer for the length of time you can typically safely freeze meats. But I don't know if I have any leg to stand on to take it to the next step, especially since ""it's technically frozen"".

With my apartment rental I have access to a garage (without a door) where I pay for parking. The landlord recently put up a security camera there, and notified me after the fact via text they were being placed for security reasons. I have not consented to anything. I am sure they are allowed to have the camera as it is an outdoor space that watches the outside of the premises and a back entrance. However, my landlord recently texted me to ask if I had a second dog (I am allowed 1) because my sister was visiting and I we were both walking outside the apartment with our dogs. She said she saw two dogs on the ""security camera"" footage. I am not really comfortable with this level of spying, but I have had a difficult time trying to figure out what my rights are in this case.


Does anyone know of any good resources for this issue? Should I ask the landlord to draw up a privacy agreement to specify what the cameras can be used for? Should I speak with a lawyer or tenant rights advocate? 


Any advice would be welcome.

I have new landlords who are renovating the whole building - except the rooms with tenants in them. Because of the quality of the contractors who they have hired (who have put in no protections whatsoever to prevent exposure of the materials to the tenants and workers), I suspect there have been no measures put in place to confirm whether asbestos and lead and other materials in the old walls have now been airborne as a result of the renovations.

I let it go because I figure I spent most of my time in my room, and not the hallways. Now, they broke something in my room and I have to move out for a couple weeks.

What should I do? I've mentioned this to my landlords and they have assured me that the new material they are putting in does not have dangerous materials - but I am more concerned about what is already in the walls/the old building. It's unclear if they will actually do anything about getting an asbestos inspector in because it could raise the cost of their entire renovation.

From across the room. Before approaching him again, arms down, which is when I was battered. I’d like to press charges. But not if they’re going to try to pin something silly on me just because I’m a human being whose just as susceptible to being angry as anyone else. I’m worried they’ll turn it on me because of my body language. 

Last night at work, I got into it with a coworker. I have a witness that saw me repeatedly try to disengage, asking him to walk away, leave the area, etc. because I saw things were escalating and I didn’t want them to. I was trying to avoid him getting violent and it took a lot to even get me to the point that I was yelling back. after so long of him not leaving, I tried to walk away myself. He continued antagonizing and threatening me verbally— I’m on camera across the room, picking something up as if I’m going to throw it, promptly setting it down, pacing, before walking back over to him because something he said set me off.

I was incredibly angry and there were a lot of impulses I was fighting. However, I never laid a hand on him. I was not aiming to intimidate or threaten him. I was just incredibly, incredibly angry, and being diagnosed BPD, controlling my anger is INCREDIBLY difficult. I still managed fighting those impulses though. I never touched him, didn’t actually throw anything, didn’t push him, didn’t verbally threaten him. Nothing. Just gestured. I had a witness that saw what happened in the moments after I approached him. My arms were at my side. My fists weren’t even clenched. I wasn’t assuming the posture of someone who’s about to strike a person. So him battering me absolutely was not a precautionary thing.  He was angry and wanted to harm me and has a history of losing his temper.

When I approached him, we yelled back and forth in an incredibly close proximity for a few moments— we were in each other’s faces, and that’s when he started battering me. He punched me many times. I’m also seen on camera immediately turning away from him when he struck me. Tried to flea/walk away, and he followed behind me. Pinned me against a counter striking the side of my face and the back of my head with me turned away from him, shielding my face,  instinctively curled in on myself in a bit of a fetal position to protect myself. And, yknow. Had it been a preemptive thing he did because he felt threatened, he wouldn’t be seen on camera *chasing after me just to beat me.* Again, didn’t try to hit him back even once because I know better. but I’m still concerned.

If just gesturing/having “aggressive” body language without verbal threats isn’t considered intimidation, great! I can press charges and not have to worry about getting in trouble myself. But I’m on unsupervised probation and will get violated if I’m charged with something and my probation will be revoked. So while I know I did nothing to harm him, I want to be sure before I take a chance.  I don’t want to get in trouble just because I was visibly angry in the moments leading up to *me* getting *beaten, and followed just to get beat some more when I tried to escape.* maybe it’s a silly concern, idk.

In the disclosure form provided to us by the seller, we were informed that the roof was approximately 12 years old. The disclosure form also stated that there had been a shingle that was blown off of the roof, and they needed to do some bedroom ceiling repair. In our back and forth with the seller, we inquired about which bedroom ceiling had been repaired, to which they replied ""The bedroom closest to the front of the house"". In our walkthroughs following this email thread, we inspected the bedroom closest to the front of the house to ensure that everything appeared to be fully repaired and there were no concerning signs of damage.

Come March, when it began to rain heavily again, we quickly experienced a leak in a different bedroom in an area of the ceiling that had only been identified by the inspector as ""scratches and scrapes in ceiling"", which, to us, indicated surface-level damage. However, we quickly pieced together that these ""scratches and scrapes in ceiling"" were where the bedroom ceiling repair was done.

Fast forward through this summer, and we have had two roofers unsuccessfully attempt multiple times to fix the leak, and we have taken on a substantial amount of water damage. We decided (in conjunction with the other owner in our duplex) to get a new roof. We were a bit dejected and in disbelief that our previous roof had only lasted 12 years, so we began to look more closely at the disclosures provided to us. Specifically, we contacted the city to inquire about permits pulled on the property, only to find that the roof was done 17 years ago, as opposed to 12 years ago. Knowing this, and also knowing that they misled us in terms of where the initial leak had been, has left us with a sour taste in our mouths toward the seller. As you can imagine, in addition to the water damage, we have since taken on a substantial amount of expenses.

Does anyone have experience with, or advice for, seeking financial compensation from their seller for misrepresentation? While I understand Massachusetts is a ""buyer beware"" state, I believe that if you do choose to disclose information, you must be truthful in doing so, so as not to mislead the buyer. In this case, we do believe we had been misled, which ultimately changed our decision-making and ability to negotiate.

Does anyone have tips for writing a letter to the sellers? Or even seeking legal help? We have gathered the disclosure form showing the lies, the permits showing the roof was done 17 years ago, the email communications regarding the location of the ceiling repair, and have the floor plan given to us by the sellers showing which bedroom is actually closest to the front of the house.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks.",legaladvice,Purchased first home in December. Seller lied to and misled us with disclosure form in regards to status of the roof.

This being said I would pay for all of my stuff i pretty much felt independent i even payed light bill and wifi bill. Well one day i decided to stop working I had already worked a year at this company. I tried to get into school again this time being online due to covid sadly never re-enrolled. This being said one day I go out and visit my hometown (3 hours away from phoenix) where my dad lived. I realized how wrapped up in my head i felt so i wanted a breather. I didnt like my living situation in phoenix because it was super toxic so I was planning on leaving just not as soon. I told my brother and his girlfriend  that i wanted to stay at my dads for one more week ive had only been there for a week since i had gotten to my hometown and the year i was gone in phoenix we never went to visit my dad so I felt 1 more week was appropriate enough. I paid for the bus tickets because i had a pre-paid under his name all the transactions where me so i told him if anything i can reschedule the bus ticket. Well they didnt like that at all his gf started messaging me saying that as soon as i get back to phoenix i was gonna start working when they knew i was still tryna enroll my self into school so i just found them full of b.s due to his gf and other msgs as well and thought to my self like damn are they rlly tryna control me let alone his gf that i went to middle school with?!?! She was unemployed and would talk on my money pretty much comparing hers and my salary while me tryna support what a bit and her being older then me i thought she would of supported that but idk so i wouldnt pay mind to it because she honestly wasnt my guardian. So i just never went back to phx I cut ties with them and ofc when i came to visit my hometown i only brought back things i needed for a week so all of my stuff is probably tossed and probably even my new bike that i had purchased it was a 2021 bmx redline.

Thanks in advance for the advice, sorry this is long.  I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it in any way to speak to a lawyer regarding my pending separation from my company of 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background:  I'm a healthcare professional (doctor) working for a corporate hospital.  I have been with my company for 5 years, 4 of them in the same hospital.  In August of last year I renegotiated my contract.  Rather than asking for a large increase in pay (commensurate with what I was bringing in to the hospital), I negotiated that my schedule would remain the same.  I had been working the same schedule for over a year prior to this contract negotiation.  The hospital director agreed to this, and added the following wording to my contract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Employee's duties, responsibilities, location and schedule will be consistent with current practices and will not change materially absent further mutual written agreement between Employee and Employer.*

&amp;#x200B;

My previous agreement did not have the ""and schedule"" portion, but the rest of the language was the same.

&amp;#x200B;

For a full year after this contract was signed (there is an auto-renewal clause, so no new contract has been negotiated nor signed since last year), my schedule remained the same as it was the year prior to the contract (so currently I have been working the same fixed schedule for the last 2.5 years).  Recently they hired a new Hospital Director, who immediately told me my schedule was going to have to change to a weekly rotating schedule consisting of days, mids, and overnights, including many weekend shifts (schedule for the last 2.5 years has been two Sundays per month, all day shift, same days each week).  I pointed out to her that my contract says that my schedule will not change unless agreed upon in writing, and she said ""I spoke to legal and that is not enforceable.  Your schedule has to rotate.""  I told her that rotating does not work for me, and as the most senior doctor in the hospital, my schedule was negotiated over an increase in salary, time off, or other material benefits.  After multiple meetings with her (during which ""legal"" somehow was never available), she again told me that the schedule has to rotate without exception, and I told her that ""unfortunately, because of this I am going to have to officially give my notice of resignation.""  This was witnessed via phone by another manager.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the kicker: I've been speaking with HR to determine how much vacation I'll be paid for, how long my benefits will last after employment, COBRA, etc., and during our conversation today he told me that neither HR nor the legal department have a copy of my contract that was signed last year.  There is NO CHANCE that my boss spoke to ""legal"" regarding my contract, as the legal department did not even have a copy.  She lied to my face in order to get me to acquiesce to her schedule demands, and the fundamental change in schedule was the sole reason I resigned.  For complete clarity, there are other doctors who do work a rotating schedule as described, and I was one of them until approximately 2.5 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not want to resign, but a rotating schedule that includes overnights for weeks at a time is not something I physically or mentally can do at this point in my career.  I had told my previous boss that I was ""a lifer"" at this hospital, because I truly love the other doctors and our support staff, as long as my schedule remained the same.  I have not yet secured other employment, mostly because I have't found a good fit yet, though I've had multiple offers.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this worth contacting an attorney who practices employment law in New Jersey?  I don't even know what I'd expect from this, but I was lied to and my contract was breeched, and I felt forced to resign as a result.  Am I wrong for being so upset or is this something I should potentially pursue?",legaladvice,"Should I seek an attorney to contact my employer about being lied to regarding my employment contract being ""not enforceable"" which lead to a significant change in my work schedule and my ultimate resignation?

We have rescued two feral cats. One of them, who we’ve had for 7 years, while incredibly sweet, was still very wild in nature and impossible to keep inside. 
On a Saturday morning about two weeks ago, I woke up wondering where she was, because she usually sleeps by my feet on the bed. I got up and saw her laying on the floor, looking not right. I picked her up and realized that she couldn’t use her back legs. I immediately brought her to the emergency vet. Before I left with her I happened to notice some very unusual, bright green poop next to her litter box and fortunately I thought to bring it with us. 
The moment the vet saw the poop, he said that it was clearly Tom Cat or similar brand rat poison, containing the strong neurotoxin Bromethalin, and that she was very unlikely make it. There was a very large amount of it and it looked exactly like the green bricks of poison, only somewhat digested. She somehow had access to, and had eaten, a very large pile of the straight poison. 
Long story short, she became completely paralyzed by evening. We thought she would pass in the night, but did not. She suffered very much. I brought her back to the vet first thing the next morning and had her put out of her suffering. It was traumatic to our children who had to see their beloved pet die a very horrific death. 
We did put a notice at the mailboxes at the beginning of the development warning other pet owners what had happened. 

My question is: is there any legal course of action that I can take? Should we at least make a police report? I have no way of knowing if it was intentional or accidental, and I don’t know for sure who did it, though, like I said, we don’t have very many neighbors.

I recently left my employer for a better opportunity. It was on good terms and after a 2 weeks notice. They sent me a severance offer along with an NDA that waives my right to sue for discrimination, a non-disparagement clause, and all the stuff that you'd expect in a severance NDA.

It includes things like: 

1. General release of claims
2. Waiver of CA Civil Code section 1542
3. Acknowledge and affirmation (no claims are pending or going to be filed against company, no discrimination, etc)
4. Confidentiality and return of property
5. Non-disparagement
6. Governing law and interpretation
7. Arbitration
8. No admission of wrongdoing

I am a teacher in Phoenix. Our PTA is only one woman, a parent who has held the position for years. She doesn’t even have children at our school. I have suggested multiple times hosting an event to get more people to join, but I have been shot down by her and our Principal multiple times. He keeps saying that he has tried that and no one is interested so it’s easier for it to just be this one woman since she’s willing to do it. 

My department has held multiple fundraisers over the years. We usually bring in $2K-3K every year via these fundraisers. 

Last year, I asked her to please let me know how much my department had available in our account. She has answered this in the past. However, when I asked last year she kept asking me to just let her know what I wanted to buy and she would see if she had enough. Repeated questions as to the amount in the count were ignored. 

This year, I once again asked her for how much was in our account so I could order something. She once again asked me to just tell her what I wanted. I said I wanted to know the amount in the account so I could make future decisions based on that amount. 

A few days later my principal emailed me, told me she had spoken to him, and that he would be buying whatever it was I wanted with the school budget instead. Which I did, but now that it’s been a week since that conversation I keep going back to it. The whole thing seems really shady. Why can’t I know how much my department has available? We raised that money and I was told the money had to be given to the PTA at the time. 

Is there a reporting agency for PTAs or someone else I can request an anonymous audit through?

My wife has stayed friends with her ex parents for the last almost 30yrs. They love each other. They have a disabled daughter who is in her 40s but cannot function on her own at all and has been in a home for most of her life. She basically has the mind of maybe an older child. The daughter and my wife are very close. 

Her parents both passed away within a month of each other. There is no will or any paperwork. Throughout the years it was always talked about that if anything happened my wife would take over care but apparently nothing was done. Now it falls on my wife and I dont known if we can do it.

The home is applying to be her payee so that isn't something my wife needs to worry about but if decisions need to be made my wife doesn't want to turn her over to the state but this seems more than we can handle. We called an attorney and it will be around 1200 and that is something we cannot do. We would try to do it ourselves but the process seems difficult and time consuming. If it requires multiple trips downtown that is also something we cannot do.

Is there any resources that can help my wife do this for little to no cost or is it easier to do on our own than it seems to be? Obviously the daughter is very distraught over this and is begging my wife to step in. The home is aware and is willing to do what they can to help but has only offered up the guardianship papers that were signed long ago for our attorney to look at.

Now that I am out of the military after 8 years, I am trying to further my education and go back to school.

I verified this numerous times, because once I paid this off, I would no longer have any student loan related debt. 

I paid this amount off in full through their third party agency and notified the school and asked to get the information I needed to log in to my decades old student account. I was quickly notified that the hold had in fact been dropped about a month prior to me paying off the amount in full, and now there were ""quite a few holds"" on my account related to tuition fees, despite the fact that my tuition was paid for by the military.

I work for a team of managers (not lawyers, admin) and since starting the job it’s been horrible. Here are SOME of the things I’ve dealt with on the job: 

1) One of my Managers made a disgusting comment about my fertility ( I am in my 30s) stating that I better not have any kids because if I did they would “come out retarded”. I told them immediately that I was offended by the comment and that my reproductive system was not their concern. This Manager then laughed in my face. Then on three separate occasions (whenever I was speaking with a male colleague) she would say it again (always out of the blue. My coworkers and I do not speak about such matters). She would ask them to promise her they “would never marry a woman my age because she would give them retarded babies”. This made for a very uncomfortable work environment and obviously my coworkers were embarrassed as well. 

2) The same manager during meetings has made fun of the workload that I have (it’s a lot), and mocked me crying and having a panic attack because at times I’m overwhelmed with work. I have never cried or had a panic attack in anyone’s presence at work. And yes, if you are visualizing, she literally looked like she was writhing in pain, fake crying and dry heaving. During a meeting, in front of the entire team. I should note that I had explained to my admin that because of the stress of everything I was dealing with on the job (harassment, bullying, overworked, etc.) that I had started suffering from depression and panic attacks. I’m assuming my admin told this manager because after I had that conversation, this manager started being up panic attacks, etc in a joking, bullying manner. She has also attempted to diminish my role constantly making comments that “Only a person who has no ambition and no pride would be an assistant. That’s why you’re so good at it.”, for starters. 

3) This manager has called me “Nappy headed”, “fat” and an “Ugly Bitch”. 

4) This manager started a witch hunt at my job with a group of young women. They would film me at company events, not respond to emails in order for me to complete tasks and were just behaving in disgusting mean girl fashion. This manager was aware of it and when she caught wind that I was going to say something, she advised me not to since She didn’t want me to “label myself as the typical angry “poc” woman”. 

5) My other manager constantly gives me her assignments (in addition to my own, along with the other bosses) while she works a second job. She then constantly harasses me to quickly get the work done. She also calls me when I’m out sick multiple times a day and if I dont answer, threatens to fire me. It could be something as simple as, “Did you print and file xy document?” Im serious. I should also note that while she wears many hats, she has made a few of those tasks my responsibility, benefits for example. When I asked for a title change/promotion, my administrator stated that it wouldn’t be fair to that specific manager, but that he was aware that I handle everything. 

6) I should note there is another assistant on the job who does nothing. She walks around chatting with coworkers and is protected by the administrator because “she has kids” and there will be guilt in firing her. However, I am screamed and yelled at if I’m unable to get twenty tasks done in the span of 5 minutes. This employee has health issues (as do I ), but she clearly gets a pass. 

7) One of the managers referred to me as the “slave” and the Administrator as my “slave master”. Nothing happened. I was on a call and was shocked and couldn’t say anything. My administrator also heard, turned bright red and that’s it. 

8) I had to take a medical leave due to the stress of everything and my doctor admitted me to a psychiatric hospital. I was out for 17 weeks and I am now on multiple psych medications. While I was out, one of the managers was allowed to let invoices (vendors and temps. A total of 105 invoices) and other work pile up on the side for me to complete upon my return to work from medical leave. 

9) My administrator is aware of everything. He has witnessed some situations and things he didn’t know I told him as I made a formal complaint to him. He took notes, as far as I know (over the phone) and stated he will deal when we returned to the office. It’s been over a year now and work has gone on as usual. We hire, fire, give reviews, interview, etc. but he still has not conducted any investigations and my work environment remains toxic. Worse actually because he has proven that he will not do anything. Now when I bring things up he states “he doesn’t remember.”. I should also make clear, many times I didn’t say anything because my Admin (when I first started) told me he didn’t want me arguing or dealing with petty crap. He wanted me to allow him to deal with it. Clearly this is now a regret of mine, as it has all snowballed for not being assertive enough. 

That’s just a few things. Sorry it’s so long. 

Besides leaving, what are my options? I’m currently looking for other work, but I cannot take the stress of the job. Many people have gotten laid off, with severance pay and I’m also wondering if I could do the same.

Basically, I have a friend who is in jail for breach of probation. She seems to be under the impression she is going to be hit with further charges, just before she gets out, as a couple of her cellmates had their sentences extended due to further charges being added. She seems to think the authorities are bound by a time limit where they have to charge you within x days/weeks, or drop the charges, and that her cellmates were already part of an ongoing investigation when they went in. She got that idea from some fellow cellmates, sterling legal source, I know. 

Further, she thinks these charges are related to unaccounted for misdemeanors from her past. She has a long rap sheet (or whatever you call it) and can't remember what she's paid off or done jail time for. She's afraid because the prosecutor said something along the lines of ""her misdemeanors haven't caught up with her yet"". I thought he was just being poetic, but she's convinced he meant they're going to charge her for those misdemeanors. She's asked me to look into these misdemeanors to determine what, if anything, is still outstanding (i.e. that they could charge her with) but I honestly can't make heads or tails of what I'm reading. There's date stamps and sometimes dollar values but nothing that easily reads ""case closed"" or ""balance outstanding"". It would be helpful if I could just type her name in and get search results like ""[Friend], due in court xx/xx/xxxx to pay fine for blah blah"". Is there somewhere I could/should look to get more concise results?

I purchased 4 interlinked, wireless fire alarms from an online retailer on 5th May 2021. I had to manually pair the 4 alarms together by pressing a series of buttons in the correct order, while listening to the beeps and flashing lights. I thought I’d paired them successfully, but from day 1, they would go off at random intervals for a few seconds. I, plus a few others, tried to re-pair them over the next 2 months, but the issue continued, so I deemed they were then faulty and it was not user error.

I advised the online retailer on 9th July and requested a refund. They replied on 13th July saying I’d have to have a call with the manufacturer first to determine if they were in fact faulty. I replied on 18th July with a list of dates I was free for the call. I received no reply by 29th July, so I sent a follow up email with more dates of my availability. 

I had an email back the same day asking to have the call on 3rd August. The call was a waste of time. I explained the issue and that I was just looking for a refund. The man said they sounded faulty so just to tell them that he had authorised the refund. It was a 1 minute long call.

I (wrongly) assumed the retailer would have been updated with this progress, but I hadn’t heard anything by 12th august, so emailed requesting the refund.

I had heard nothing back by yesterday (18th august), so called them wanting it resolved that day and saying I’d even accept replacement. They advised they were very understaffed due to covid so no one could help me immediately, and he could get someone to call me back ASAP. I heard nothing that day, so decided to call back that afternoon.

I spoke with the sales director who advised they hadn’t had confirmation from the manufacturer that they were faulty so had to verify my claim. He said he’d contact them and get back to me. He couldn’t give a timescale but said if I hadn’t heard anything back by the following day (today - 19th august) at 10am to call back. He said he couldn’t just refund/replace them as it had been after 30 days I had reported them faulty. 

I heard nothing again so called at 2pm today. The person I spoke with advised the man who was looking into it (the sales director from yesterday) had now finished for the day, so he would speak to him tomorrow and call me back. I’m really not happy.

I’ve looked into this. Apparently after 30 days, you have to let them make one attempt to replace or repair in a ‘reasonable’ time frame.

I asked the contractor when it would be completed. He told me mid-April. I asked to have it put in the contract that the work would be completed by May 1st. We agreed that would give him plenty of time. 

May June and July came and went.  He dug up my driveway on July 27th. He was supposed to dig one day, put down gravel the next day, and then pour concrete the third day.

I guess it's worth mentioning that the day he would start digging changed three times before he actually dug. 

Same with putting down the gravel, three delays. 

Today was the 5th rescheduled day to pour the concrete.

He is quickly approaching 4 months late. 

I know I kind of messed up by letting him start the job. I would have had grounds to just get my deposit back and find a different contractor had I not let him start. 

Here's the reasons I think I should get a discount:

We had ordered a camper trailer.  It was supposed to be delivered towards the end of June. I wanted the driveway in place so we had a place to park it (contractor knew this). I'd already put down a deposit on the RV and couldn't back out. So my wife and I have been parking our cars in the streets since RV takes up the whole driveway. 

The first day he said he was going to dig out the driveway I moved the RV into the yard, I put it on boards so that it would not sink in and leave dents in the yard. But He didn't actually start digging for a week so its in the yard for 4 weeks now. It is very clearly sinking in a lot considering that we had two big rain storms since then. (I would have been able to move the camper back to the driveway before the rain had he poured on schedule)

I took several days off work for days that he was supposed to be here and then never showed. I've taken a total of 5 days off work through this process, three of which were for days when Just never showed up.  

Because of his extreme delays, the driveway project overlap our roof replacement. I thought leaving 3 months between would be plenty of time but no. Monday of this week he calls me and tells me he's going to pour Wednesday. I tell him the roofers are supposed to be dropping off shingles on Wednesday and need to back across the packed gravel to load shingles to the roof.  I told him I'll call and reschedule them. 

I rescheduled the roofers for Thursday. Then on Wednesday he calls me and tells me he's going to come Thursday instead.  I called the roofers back and rescheduled them for that day. I Explained the situation luckily they are very flexible. 

Later on Wednesday the driveway contractor calls me and says it's going to be The following Monday.  I kind of got upset with him and told him I just rescheduled the roofers twice to accommodate him.  He backpedaled and said he would be there Thursday. 

He accidentally ripped out my sidewalk. Replacing the sidewalk was not in the contract. I guess he was confused cuz he just started tearing it up with the bobcat. I stopped him before he tore it all up. He talked me into just letting him replace The entire sidewalk since it wouldn't match the driveway anyway. (Then today he mentioned something about adding an extra $400 for replacing the sidewalk)

Not sure if there's matters but my sidewalk had heater wires built into melt snow in the winter. He said he can't replace those so I just don't have that anymore. 

Giant pile of dirt. The contract stated that he would dig and haul away dirt and old driveway. But he left a giant pile of dirt approximately two cubic yards in my yard.  Instead of hauling it away he wants to just spread it out on my yard and put grass seed down.  I wouldn't mind using some of the dirt to fill in the divots left by my camper, but I don't want my whole yard to be a mud hole for weeks until the grass grows. 

Also does anybody know if I need to lien waivers directly from the company that delivered the gravel and the company doing the actual concrete work?  I've discovered through the process that he's actually subcontracting out both of those things. All he really does is dig. He's going to give me a lien waiver for his company. But I worry what happens if he doesn't pay his vendors.",legaladvice,Requesting discount from contractor for extreme delays and other shenanigans.

Backstory:
---
Prior to working with Pervert Dean, Lauren has heard from multiple co-workers about his unsettling behavior. Overly sexual, brash, and has ZERO boundaries. 

Story #1 from co-worker

While he was partnered with an 18 y.o. EMT, he would caress his hand in her inner thigh as he was driving

Story #2 from co-worker

A male EMT accidentally tucked his shirt into his underwear instead of his pants so Pervert Dean reaches to the deep into pants to give him a wedgie. 
This resulted in the male EMT to flip out and draw his fist on Pervert Dean. Highly inappropriate. 

Story #3 from co-worker

Pervert Dean said to a male co-worker along the lines of ""I'm going to bed you over that table and *blank"" you silly""
---
So after hearing all of these crazy stories from co-workers Lauren grew concerned because she was scheduled to work with him. 
Being the kind-hearted person that she is, she gave him the benefit of doubt to see how he would act while driving dispatch. 

Unfortunately, it wasn't any different at all. Her experience with Pervert Dean was terrible. 
Apparently, he is somewhat reserved with the first meeting so he can wait for them to lower their guard. Once it's lowered, then he starts becoming explicit with his conversation. 

Don't get me wrong, being stuck in a vehicle with someone for 12 hours, things will come out as you get more comfortable with the person but if the other party does not feel comfortable or safe or consent, then it's time to back the F off. 

During their drive, he made snide comments about her being hispanic and that she probably likes to do or is really good at particular bedroom acts. She can't recall much of it because she has blocked it from her memory. Towards the end of their shift, he started becoming touchy with her shoulder and it was at this point she was gripping her baton that she carries with her for safety because it was truly making her uncomfortable. 

Thankfully, their shift ended and she met up with her other co-workers where they checked up on her to see how she was doing. She wasn't doing well. 

She wrote a lengthy email reporting the incident to management and nothing has come up with it yet aside from ""they will forward it to HR"". 

She is scheduled to work with him tomorrow and if she hears nothing back, she is going to call out of work. 

My concern is that if she calls out because of Pervert Dean, it will backfire on her and it can cost her job. One girl left the company because of Pervert Dean, according to Lauren. 

How can she protect herself in case the company does not side with her? (this is just me thinking worst case scenario)

I have half a mind to follow her to work and talk to this guy but I don't think that would bode well at all. Or expose him to his wife idk.

Posting on behalf of my parents.  They have a 2003 Volkswagen GTI.  Very low miles and extremely good condition.   It's got a 5 speed *Tiptronic* auto transmission, which are kind of known to be fragile and problematic.    

The car developed a very hard first to second shift.  It would slam into gear.   The shop is a Volkswagen/Audi specific shop I have used before on a couple of my cars.   The guys there seemed knowledgeable and the owner was a great guy.   

They replaced the transmission solenoids and all was well.

About two months later, the car started having an intermittent low oil pressure warning and my parents wanted the car to be picked up and looked over by the same shop.   I arranged for them to come pick up the car with their trailer and when they tried to load the car onto the trailer, the car wouldn't move in drive. 

We pushed the car onto the trailer and got the car towed.  The main focus became the transmission.   They had the car less than a week and determined the transmission was junk and would need replaced.    We asked them to find out how much a used or remanufactured transmission would cost or explore the possibility of converting the car to a manual transmission. 

They had the car over 3 months with no word or movement on the car...always saying they are unable to find the right transmission.  Finally they said they had located one from LKQ and gave a price of around $2700 for parts and labor.   My mom got a loan from the bank to pay for this and gave the go-ahead.

Another almost-two-months go by.  Excuses of there not being a lift open, back logs of cars to be worked on, employees quitting, etc.  Meanwhile, they close early on Friday or not work on Friday at all to go to race events out of state, the owner is buying another house, etc.   My parents are beyond frustrated and just want their car fixed. 

Finally they tell us it's done (plus we owe another $500 for fluids and stuff not on the invoice)   We go pick up the car and all is fine for 2 weeks.  Then one day the car won't shift out of first gear.   They send someone out who says it must be low on fluid.  He scans the car and gets no codes.  He resets the battery and the car shifts again but starts getting stuck in gear after a few minutes.   He suggests getting the car back to the shop to get the fluid changed or checked. 

We make arrangements with insurance to have the car towed back to the shop across town, which actually is more than the free mileage insurance covers and my mom had to pay $30 difference.

They get the car back to the shop and call us two days later saying the car is done and shifts fine.   They called the adjuster from LKQ out and he did some tests and scanned it and it had no codes and it seemed fine.   I did actually see the guys from the shop driving the car around the day before because the shop is close to my office.   They said they did a transmission service, new filter, flush and fluid. (Of course they covered the cost, but why they didn't do all that to begin with is beyond me...).     We go to pick up the car and we don't even make it out of the parking lot because it's still stuck in first gear.   Take it back.  One of the guys gets in himself and drives it down the parking lot before coming back and saying he was going to have the LKQ adjuster come out again and make him stick around until the problem comes back. 

We get a call a couple days later saying that they drove the car around ""all day for two days"" and it shifted fine. There are no codes.   They are not going to call LKQ out again because there's nothing wrong and it working.   The adjuster won't do anything.

My mom got into a kind of heated conversation with the guy from the shop and he said that the best thing they can do is come get the car and drive it until it stops working again and call them back.   We went and got the car.  It shifted normally....actually better than it ever had.   My stepdad drove the car back and forth to work for a week and a half and one morning the car is stuck in first gear again.   

The guy from the shop said ""Not much we can do until this thing completely fails unfortunately based on the guidelines LKQ have set in place.  We can schedule another inspector but we are booked out 5 weeks before we can get anything new on a lift.""

We called LKQ to get some info on warranty and talk to their guy who worked with the shop. That guy said that the shop didn't seem to have much interest in fixing the car when he spoke to them and suggested finding another shop.  

We just want the car fixed.  They have already spent $3k and we're damn near in the same spot we were in at the beginning.   The shop didn't fix the car and seems like they've just given up.

Im 17. When i was younger, about 6-8/9, I manipulated someone who was 2 years younger than me to do sexual things. nothing penetrative, just coercing them to get naked. i was exposed to sexual stuff early on and it caused me to be like that. one of my cousins was there too but he was never involved physically, he just watched. i made it seem like it was a game to them. i want to apologise to both people now but i need to fully internalise the idea that pedophilia is absolutely harmful. i feel like if i dont atleast do that, then my apology is fake. but at the same time i want to apologise as quick as possible before they feel traumatised. 2 years ago i briefly apologised to them about it but it shouldve been longer and the nerves got to me. i was satisfied with it at the time but my ocd made me realise a longer apology is necessary. and its worse cus last time the main reason i apologised was because i felt horrible for this persons mother who always treated me good and i did something like that with her daughter. this womans lost a son as well so i think its absolutely necessary that my apology is from the heart and comes from a place of guilt. i dont care if this person lets everyone know what has happened. if it feels like a burden then they have the right to speak about it. the problem is that i need to fully internalise that pedophilia is bad before i apologise or else it isnt a genuine apology. but everytime i try to, i feel like my OCD makes it so much harder to accept the facts. like makes it seem as if i nitpick every fact. 

unfortunately my younger brother was involved in this one time as well. he was, again, never physically involved but was there once from what i remember. he was maybe like 2 at the time maybe 3 (hes six years younger than me). then when i was 12 i felt an urge to 'moon' my brother. it was one time and it felt like there was some sexual motivation behind it. We used to share one double bed and at night id get the urge to masturbate sometimes. i would have no where to go but the bathroom so id just do it on the my bed. id wait for him to go to sleep or be distracted while he was watching some youtube video and id scoot over to my side as much as possible, id use the blanket to cover myself and make some sort of border between us and id just masturbate without taking off my trousers and id make sure i didnt make it obvious at all. this sounds so embarassing but it needs to be said. im fairly certain he never suspected anything but im aslo scared that i might have slipped once or twice and he may have realised. this past year i realised how bad all this was and i hope to god my brother doesnt remember any of it since these situations were pretty rare. but like a month ago, me and my younger brother were in the car and i had an erection. i thought it blended in with all the other curves of my shorts so i didnt bother hiding it too much. my brother saw it and he nervously smiled at me. i turned away, still not concealing it because i didnt want to make him think i knew what he saw. from the corner of my eye, i think he was still looking down there so this is where i tried to subtly hide it as best as possible. at this point i was worried enough that he had seen it but then i look the other way after a couple of minutes and something catches my eye. he seemed to have an erection too. this worried me extremely. i dont want him to be attracted to me in any way, i dont want him to have a twisted childhood like mine, i want him to have a good life. what do i do? I kinda want to over time get closer to him in a brotherly way and set him on the right path. i also dont wanna force it because thats a fake relationship then and thats not right. i hope he doesnt descend down a twisted path later on in his life i really hope not. What do I do? 

the last thing is to do with my male cousin. hes older by a year and i was 5 at the time so he was 6. i coerced him into doing sexual things as well. once or twice. the last time it happened, his older brother caught us and threatened to tell everyone if he ever saw us doing it again. we never did it again. this cousins father is straight up emotionally abusive. he thinks its discipline whereas its literal emotional abuse, ive noticed it, my parents have noticed it, as a parent hes terrible. my cousins now just turned 19 but has the maturity of a 12 year old. this condition i believe is called arrested development and its caused when trauma occurs in a persons life which causes their development to be stunted at the age of trauma. so i think his dad probably started the emotional abuse at around 12 which caused a stunt in development. next time i see them im gonna tell my aunt to take him to a psychiatrist to treat him as well as to ask her husband to really turn it down with the unnecessary emotional abuse hes put on his son. i was worried that this stunt in development came from what we did but looking at it objectively i feel like the only reason his developments stunted is because of the trauma his familys put on him. on top of that, hes joked about what we did in the past like 3/4 years ago. why would he joke about a traumatic experience unless of course it wasnt traumatic for him. the thing is im worried about what will happen if they take him to a therapist and the problem still doesnt get solved because the source of the abuse is actually from what we did together when we were younger? I also get the feeling that the uncle is too prideful to take responsibility for what he has done. I just find it really unlikely that what we did caused his maturity stunt. 1) because his dad is actually emotionally abusive and his brothers put a lot of pressure on him. in fact, ive grown up with them but i can only think of one occasion where the uncle treated my cousin with respect. 2) the age at which we did what we did was 5 years before his apparent age of maturity stunt which is around 12. 3) hes joked and laughed about the incident in the past. i dont see why he would joke about something that was so traumatic, it stunted his maturity. chances are, it probably wasnt. 

i feel like if the therapy doesnt work it might be because the source of trauma was wrong or because the therapy wasnt strictly followed. and im inclined to believe the latter because like i said, the dad seems very prideful to take responsibility. but this makes me feel like im morally flawed or that im in denial. i have no issue with him telling his therapist and so the rest of the family about our incident as long as theres a reason. feeling depressed  or anxious by it is one reason. knowing full well that it is the source of the stunt is another. but taking a risk and telling the therapist about it while other plausible explanations exist doesnt feel right to me. but then i feel like if i dont, ill have wasted away his life he couldve had because i was too cowardly to say anything and that would make me feel really guilty. I dont mind the therapist and the rest of our family knowing as long as there is a reason for it. the last thing i wanna do is to come clean about it for no reason. 

the point of this post is, What do i do? Do i pursue these thoughts and fears or do i just use exposure therapy as is advised for OCD patients? Any advice is appreciated. a lot of you will be mad about this post. if you are thats fine, be as harsh as you want but please just give me advice.

They have lived in a nice neighborhood for almost two decades. There is a house next door to them that a really sweet widow had owned until she passed away a year ago. Now, the lady's children have bought it and are moving in. The original lady was kind but her daughter and son in law that are moving in next month, are not. The daughter is a doctor and husband is a lawyer, in their early sixties and they want to retire in the town my mom and dad are in. 

Yesterday my mom saw the husband outside. He had just gotten the land surveyed. He was using a string around all of the poles. My mom went outside and realized that the poles were a few feet into their (my parents') property. My mom talked to him but he told her to have her husband call him. My mom even showed him a survey my parents got themselves two years ago. The land was also surveyed 7 years ago as well. Both show the survey this new guy got is wrong. 

My father got home from work and called him and I know my father and I know he isn't an abrasive person and always treats people with respect. My father is an immigrant and came to the states 43 years ago. He is a doctor and works with people every single day, 60 hours a week and no one ever says they can't understand him. So, he's talking to this neighbor and the neighbor said, ""are you from the middle east or something? Your accent is so thick I can hardly understand you."" My dad is not from Afghanistan. Even if he was, what would be the issue with that? Then he goes on to tell my dad TWICE that ""there are laws in the U.S. unlike where he is from."" Apparently the guy was all around rude and insulating. 

My mom and dad went to the city and the city said there isn't anything they can do until the new neighbors actually build on their property, which in the evening after this happened, they did. So now my parents have to go to the city again this morning. I guess the new neighbors have already been awful to every person in the neighborhood but I'm worried about my parents living next to people like that.

I started therapy 11 months ago with very clearly defined goals on the areas of my mental health where I needed help - the therapist was aware of it since day one and we decided that let's do a few sessions together to see if we are a good fit. Three sessions in we decided we are

I asked for an assessment and a plan, my homework and insights. She told me its a process that can't be rushed and I should just trust the process and use these sessions to unload as much as I can and the process she has will help me in near term future

The sessions kept on happening with an expectation from my end and this is according to a plan that she has and will lead somewhere. I kept on sliding in depression, made poor financial decisions largely because of it and my work life suffered a lot because of my mental health but I stuck to the course because to me that was road to recovery and I wanted to trust the process

Last month during a difficult time for me, I explained everything I'm going through with her to which she offered nothing and ended the session even earlier than usual saying that she'd be out for the next three weeks. That made me wonder if she even has a plan for me or is actually invested in my mental health - with more digging in the next session I realized she actually never had a plan because even when I explicitly asked her to provide feedback on my own development or lack of or the areas I should work on - she had no clue! It felt like she's meeting me for the first time every time

I am now beyond frustrated - I wasted eleven months of my life trusting a professional who essentially wasted my time and money for absolutely nothing and now she has also refused to discuss this further! I want to explore my options on what I can do here to either get something for myself or just to make sure that she doesn't do the same thing to anyone else

tldr: therapist led me to believe there's a plan I should trust and wasted eleven months in there. At the end no feedback was provided and she refuses to discuss this any further",legaladvice,Can a therapist be sued for negligence?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7e8cf/can_a_therapist_be_sued_for_negligence/

.
I bought a house that was due for completion in 2019, around July. Have been paying for it long before it was completed because it is advertised under a Government housing scheme (PPA1M) for affordable housing. Ive began paying since 2018... Others in our telegram groups began paying since 2017.
. 
Long story short, there has been a series of delays and we see no hope of it completing this year. Making it a probable 2022 completion date. Problem is, we kinda believe that our lawyers , the one managing the housing deals are in cahoot with the developers as they mentioned that we are not going to be compensated for the late completion. We are only entitled for a RM 8 / day, which is a small reimbursement since most of us still have to pay for rents and the house loans. .
.
I believe , in my country, we are entitled to 10% of the assurance money back as they didn't complete the house 1 year after we signed the agreement.
.
So, do we have a case against them? Or will they hide behind the covid for this problem?

Second,there is a lot of backstory to this for full context before I get to my actual question, I apologize for that. I will try to keep it as brief as possible.
14 years ago my father started dating a woman with a 6-ish month old baby. They eventually married and dad and I subsequently helped raise that baby, even after the two of them divorced about five-ish years ago.

Neither my father nor I have any blood relation to this child, but shortly after the divorce the mom left them with us and went to live her own life. She did not pay for food or clothes or....anything really, but insisted dad pay her for letting the child live with us.
The child got into trouble with CPS at age 10 or so because while visiting their mother they posted sexual content on youtube. CPS said that the child had to live with mother full time because child wasnt related to us and had committed a crime. Mother agreed. This lasted 3 days before she dumped the child with us again stating she couldn't handle the child's ""bullshit"".
Dad and I deeply love this child so we agree to continue caring for them. 
Now, during this whole time the child has become increasingly belligerent and cruel, including harming me, my dad, and animals, as well as cussing us out and demeaning us. Gotta be discipline issues right? So we try to deal with it. I suggest therapy bc there seems to be something very wrong with the child. dad refuses. time goes on. It keeps getting worse. Child is increasingly violent. Threatens dad with knife. Tells me to kill myself because I'm useless. Self harms and then tries to blame it on us or other family members.
Fast forward to this year. Earlier this year while still living with us the child accused their grandfather, who has a felony record, of molesting them. We took it seriously and spoke with the whole family. Mother and grandmother decide to do nothing. Child then accuses Mom's new boyfriend of molesting them. Again, dad and I take it seriously.

Nothing is done by their blood family.

Finally, the child says they want to stay with their mom for a while. Dad is concerned but agrees. This turns into the child wanting to live with mom. We are sad, and confused, but there is nothing we can do.

Then dad gets called to the grandma's house. The child has accused my father of molesting them when they were four.....my dad is devastated. He doesn't understand, but has to accept that they no longer wish to communicate with us anymore because of this. Dad is depressed and despondent. He swears he did nothing, and considering the child's track record of accusations and the age at which the child says it happened, I do believe him. Dad feels like his life is over even though they aren't pressing charges bc he spent 14 years dedicated to and advocating for the safety and well being of this child.

He tries to kill himself but it fails.

Last night, the child contacted him out of the blue with photos and videos of them shooting a teddy bear dad had given them, and saying this is because he fucked up their mind, and its all his fault. Mom and boyfriend are present in video and laughing and mocking my father.

We have the stuff saved and have blocked the child's number and I sent a text to the mother asking her politely to disallow any further communication from the child.

Now we get to my questions...is this constant years long issue of violence against us verbally and physically considered abuse, legally? Is there anything I can do to protect my father from future harassment??

Should we press charges, and if they try to press charges against my father for these bogus assault accusations, what might happen?

I'm scared for my dad. I am scared because this child now has easy access to firearms that I know are not kept locked up. This child knows where we live and has a history of violence....but because of his age and lack of documented proof besides the videos and a few screenshots of messages from me to my friends over the years speaking about my fears and his actions I don't know if there is anything we can do legally",legaladvice,Harassment and abuse by a 14 y/o,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p7djpw/harassment_and_abuse_by_a_14_yo/

Our long-standing neighbors were a neat, elderly couple. Recently, the husband passed away and their youngest daughter, husband and high school aged kids moved in with the wife. All together they have been adding on to the house for over a year. Their yard is trashed, we see debris all the time, there are loud parties in the pool, dogs barking at 3am constantly, you name it. All of these things we have held our breath with but yesterday they literally crossed the line. 

We live in a slightly wooded area just behind the local high school and the mom expressed a desire to create a path so two of the daughters could walk to school. We discussed there had been a path before, and her late father fought to close the path, putting brush and branches over time. We told her we did not want a path on our property. There were always problems with all neighborhood kids using the path to cut through. They were loud and frequently we would find kids smoking, drinking or even having sex back there.

Generally, our property is neater because I have plants back there that I tend. Yesterday, I spotted their younger son weed-whacking on our property, creating a path to the high school. Again, we had a conversation with him and the mom. I told them this wasn't their property, that they couldn't create a path there but if they wanted to create one on their property they could. I showed them the property steak and gave a very clear description. Afterwards, I cut up a fallen tree and placed it over the path to block it. This morning, I saw the two girls walk through our property, over the cut tree while on their way to school.

I'm just sick of all of this. They're clearly wrong and continue to ignore my general statements about black and white situations.

I could be diagnosed with a mental health disease easily if there was one for something like that. We were dating for a month. She broke it off. I said ok and I went about my life. I never tried to get back with her, in fact I sorta pushed her away. But I still liked her. Anyway we broke up. Now that I look back it was for the best for me honestly.

We end up in a bathroom with her blowing me(both of us consensually). We split up after I finished and we never met up again.

Labcorp took my blood in May but did the wrong blood work test. I have epilepsy and my blood has to be checked every 3 months to allow me to keep driving. I've been doing this for 7-8 years so nothing new. I went back on June 7 to retake it and just assumed they would send it to Cleveland Clinic like they always do. I forgot about it and then I get a letter about my license being suspended about a month later.

I called labcorp and my doctors office, who said they don't handle it. They didn't even have a record of me coming in to take the test even though I had to make an appointment. I was listed as ""no show"" but I was definitely there. They told me to call Labcorp because I was at least listed with them but labcorp had no record of me visiting that day. None. I fought with them and told them how I'm going to lose my job because it's an hour away and now I can't drive. I'm a single mom and can't go to the grocery store, pick up meds, take my kids to school, etc., and let them know how upset I was.

That's where things get weird. The next day they call me and tell me that they found my test and sent it to Cleveland Clinic. CC calls me and tells me that I didn't pass it because my level was 0.1 and it needs to be 10. There is no way that was true because I take my meds every single day. That would mean that I didn't take them at all pretty much.

All of my blood results are always posted on their website and this one wasn't. There is nothing there to prove my test came back as that. I am feeling like they made that up because they didn't want to get into trouble for losing my test and causing me a lot of risk. Luckily I didn't lose my job but it caused a lot of issues with doctor appointments, grocery shopping, etc. I could barely find anyone to give me rides to places.

I don't have any proof they lied, only that those results they had suddenly found were not put into the system, so I feel they don't really have them. There's no way I could have tested that low anyway. They did the first test wrong and this could even be wrong the second time because they had acted like they didn't know how to do it. It was a newer person taking the test and she had never done that type before. I'm not sure what the issue was but if they lied to cover something up, then they shouldn't be in business.

Wednesday morning I came in and told my boss I was feeling light headed, weak , and had almost no ability to talk. I asked to go home. He tells me to wait till lunch and see how I feel. I push along. Lunch comes. I throw up and don't feel any better. 

I let him know. He tells me he has one more thing for me to do. He wants me to swap some tires out. Here's where the issue happens. I go to move the tire to lean it against the wall. It's almost as if I lost any and all coordination. The tire began leaning my way and no matter what I did I couldn't keep it upright. Something that is never an issue. The tire proceeded to fall on my knees and knocking me down in the process. Currently I'm in a ton of pain and can barely walk.

--------
An unemployed woman is married to a psych nurse for two years. Her husband is emotionally manipulative and mentally abusive. She is an active alcoholic, and recovered meth addict with extreme depression and anxiety. She can be reactive when she gets very angry when she's drunk. 

They fight frequently over almost anything. He has frequently encouraged her to commit suicide, he has security cameras all over their home that only he can access, he controls all the money, she doesn't work. He gets angry when she talks to anyone other than him including her own children. He has frequently physically and mentally abused her 6 year old son. One 1 occasion while she was extremely intoxicated and he was bullying her emotionally she slapped him. Another time she threw a picture frame at him. He never pressed charges and she was never arrested. She never told the police about any of it, only saying ""he is a psych nurse and he will tell you im crazy but im not"".

After the last DV incident, he tells her she ows him. He tells her that she has to have sexual intercourse with him multiple times a day, every day, as well as clean and cook and do every single thing he tells her to otherwise he will put her and her 6 year old son out on the street. 

She is scared, and she knows she has mental illness and is an alcoholic. So she complies. Evey day, multiple times a day for about a month she does everything he tells her too, including anal sex which she had never done and was terrified to do but he forced her by threatening to make her and her son leave right then. 

She pretends to be ok with this arrangement,  acts as if she's grateful for the opportunity to redeem herself to him for throwing the frame at him. 

She has pages of screen shots of texts proving every detail of this story, including messages from him demanding she do these things in order to stay in her home, messages she sent to a confidont explaining what was happening and how sick it made her but she felt like she had no choice, messages she sent to her family asking if she could stay with them because she was unhappy and things were abusive and them telling her ""no"" (meaning she really had no where to go), call records showing she attempted to call DV shelters during this time but they were all full, and messages from him where he then denies everything and tells her she is making everything up and should be hospitalized.

(yes i know). i tried going back to the guy every month or so but he never seemed to ever had it done, then i got busy with finals and eventually forgot about it. flashforward to me being an adult, i remembered about the ps4 id left there years ago and decided to see what they would say about it. he worked pretty close to where my mother worked and it was a long trip so i asked her to take a look at it for me.

To not much of a surprise it was still there, she took it back. but what i received was... not my ps4. it was completely banged up, scratched, missing screws everywhere! plastic broken, rubber feet gone. Id handed it with my precious Black ops 2 and an HDMI cable never to be seen again. 

Worst part. my problem was it turned off too often. well now it does not even turn on! i was completely in rage. the culmination of all my savings as a kid gone and retuned to me in a casket. i am going there myself tomorrow for a proof of return or receipt and id like to sue.

Her new BF got in my face giving me all kinds of death threats, literally telling me he knew where I live and saying he will actually kill me and other various threats.  I was genuinely very confused. I asked what it was about as I had thought it was a generally amicable breakup. She apparently told him I filmed non-consensual videos of us having sex. This is not true, although we did film videos they were all consensual and with permission. I caught the entire interaction on my dashcam. I want to take the video to the police as I no longer feel safe, however I do not want them to try and turn it on me by telling the police ""I filmed non-consensual videos of us having sex.""

Back in 2019, my father passed away from cancer and so it ended up just being me (21) and my mom. A few months went by after his passing and she began to get into drugs, selling and doing. I had to call the police multiple times, scared of her overdosing and finding drugs in the house. Mind you, I’ve never been around drugs. I’ve never done drugs. I always had a normal upbringing up until this point.

It got so bad that I ended up moving out across the country to just have a normal life and grieve for my dad. During the time I’ve moved away, my mom has been arrested, gone to rehab, been admitted to a psych ward, lost her apartment. 

During all this nonsense I’ve called the police, done wellness checks, talked to her doctors, pleaded with her to get help. My family has completely shunned her and refuses to help. I have been unable to section her because I live in a different state and no one is willing to really help her out at this point. 

CURRENTLY, my mom has been MIA for 30 days now. She always calls me every single day to check in up until 30 days ago. Her phone was on for 2 weeks, always just ringing until it reached voicemail. Now the battery is dead, her voicemail is full. I’ve begged my family (what little I have left) to please talk to the police and they all blamed me for up and leaving and not taking care of her. I called the police again today requesting to make a missing person’s report and they didn’t take me seriously at all. I’ve contacted all her friends, her doctors and anyone else she would have been in contact with. No one has spoken to her in the last 30 days. No one is taking me seriously. I am 23 years old, full time college student and work part time. I can’t afford to fly over there and I’m very restricted with what I can do 3k miles away. 

If ANYONE has any legal advice they can give me, please do. I’m at a complete loss. She could be dead somewhere and I have no idea, no one is really helping me.",legaladvice,My mom is missing,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p79h6m/my_mom_is_missing/

I suffer from severe, though short, bouts of depression where I feel very suicidal. I'm not sure how to best explain this. I function well overall but once a month or so I get into severe episodes of depression where I start feeling suicidal for a few days, a week tops. I have had two attempts in the past. I do not feel suicidal when I am stable and thinking rationally but when in an episode I am and lately it has become very intense and I develop a plan and start googling very scary things. Once I come out of it I know I don't really want to do that. I am honestly scared of what I may do in these episodes. I do not have a criminal record or anything else that would prevent me from purchasing a gun if I wanted to. If asked if I was a danger to myself or others I would absolutely lie when in such a mental state. I currently live in Washington state in the U.S. I have tried researching if there is a way to add myself to a do not sell list. It looks like they introduced the idea in Virginia and that article mentioned WA but I cannot find any details. Is there an option for that here? Or could a family member petition the court to stop me? What are the requirements and process for that? Do we need a documented history of my mental illness? If I were to go to court about this and have a family member help me would this affect me in other ways down the line? Just trying to figure out options. I just really don't trust myself. When I'm having an episode I am not thinking rationally at all but I am very convincing. It's hard to understand if you're not mentally ill like that yourself but I hope I explained well.

Went to get the car assessed ...called the guy with the amount only to be told hell give no more than $200...I tried to give him options to pay it off monthly ,but he refused.. so I submitted to send him to small claims court.

Fast forward....he counter claimed me saying I ran over his kid in the front of my car...and that I've run over kids before and have been told to slow down numerous times...all of which are completely untrue... Not to mention I contacted the city to have the speed limit lowered and a sign put up to show that there are kids at play because we were having such an issue with speeders.. 

I'm being told that all the evidence I had is not enough even though when I first served him I was told it was... They're saying a police report is nothing but statements there's nothing in there that says anyone admitted anything.... The cop says there's no point to get his body camera...he lied and said he tried to talk to the witness but he wouldn't come to the door...

Last year I was involved in a serious road accident, in where my car (I was passenger) was t-boned by an oil tanker.

I had life threatening injuries and was air lifted to hospital and was in critical condition for two days, I had many broken bones and a lot of internal injuries.
I also have permanent scarring and a level of physical disability now.

I have a no-win-no-pay team right now who are amazing and working with me on getting compensation from my cities traffic accident commission; and that is currently in progress however I’ve been told by the police that I don’t have a strong case in suing the driver of the truck; as he wasn’t intoxicated or as far as they can tell, driving recklessly.

The driver claims his breaks gave out and he went through a red light and then proceeded to ram our car that was going through a green at an intersection.
The truck was investigated and they found no signs of the truck being driven while unsafe, nothing was wrong with it.

However I have a few truck drivers I know, who drive heavy loads everyday and say that since he was going down a steep incline it was his duty of care to make sure his breaks had enough air to get it down the hill safely and should’ve pulled over if they were failing which should’ve been obvious to him considering the truck itself wasn’t malfunctioning.

My thought process is something or someone has to be to blame for it, otherwise it would have never happened; many heavy loads go down that road everyday and if it was a perfect freak accident in which no one is to blame it would happen everyday. 
Even if it isn’t the truck driver, maybe the company that owned the trucks, or the safety of the road itself (maybe should have been more signs?) 

I understand it’s complicated and maybe I need to give up on thinking about it and accept there isn’t enough evidence because right now it’s all theory and circumstantial.

Just wanted to bring an issue weighing me down to light, and maybe gain some knowledge and understanding from you guys, as to how to handle it, or what I'm entitled/not entitled to. So background info. Universities are either mandating vaccines for students, or doing whatever they can to make unvaccinated students lives as difficult as possible. Ex. Some schools are adding extra charges to students accounts if they are not vaccinated, schools are having ONLY unvaccinated students tested 3x per week at 7 A.M. (crazy they think vaccinated kids can't get it apparently), or schools are requiring the vaccine to even be accepted. Seems a little odd to me, as these universities do nothing but promote diversity and inclusion, yet when it comes to making the decision to get the vaccine or not, it seems they have a right and a wrong determined. Now, the part that bugs me. My university is doing the 3x a week testing, at 7 A.M., and only testing unvaccinated people. Two weeks ago, we were informed it would be once a week. Crazy how quickly that changed. Only testing the unvaccinated people is a great way to skew the data and show outbreaks occurring only because of non-vaccinated students. My biggest concern, is college students, for the most part, don't have a care in the world for what they do to their body, so they will end up getting the vaccine, just so they don't have to get tested, rather than getting it because they believe in it. I will be showing up at 7 A.M., 3x a week, with a smile on my face knowing my school is blowing money and resources on getting me tested. I am in great physical shape, experienced bad reactions to vaccines previously, have already survived the delta variant, and can't be found at the bar or parties during this pandemic, yet the University is basically telling me I am not smart enough to make my own decision. With all that being said, if someone can bring this, what I would call, injustice, to light, that would be great.",legaladvice,Universities' Manipulation of Students,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p78nlw/universities_manipulation_of_students/

I was given a 45 day temporary license plate from Indiana, told that my new Illinois plates will arrive in the mail, and sent on my way. Fast forward to today, and my temporary plate expires in four days, and I never received any license plates. I contacted the Illinois Secretary of State and they said that the paperwork for my new plates has not been submitted yet, and that it will take 90 days to process before the plates are issued. So I’m about to have a brand new car that I can’t drive for At least 90 days. I contacted the dealership, and they said “stuff is really backed up right now” and advised me to “drive on expired plates, because of Covid the police are very lenient right now.” Yeah, I’m not doing that. If I knew this would be the case, I would have either not bought a car out of state, or I would have negotiated to have the dealer waive all their taxes/titles fees and registered it myself. I tried to resolve it myself so I went to the DMV, waited in line for a couple hours, and they told me that I could not register a vehicle in IL without a title (the bank has the title) and that an application had already been submitted for my VIN, but it had not been paid and no supporting documents had been provided yet. 
Do I have any recourse here, or am I just going to be stuck taking the bus for the next three months while I wait for this to get resolved? I’m going to have to rent a car for some out of state travel as well, so I’m really getting screwed here. The dealership claims it’s illegal for them to issue me another temporary plate.

My dad owns a small shop that includes beer products. He built a cooler that holds a specific amount of weight. In the lease, there was never a size limit that was agreed upon. In fact, there was nothing about the cooler at all.

The landlord sent an engineer to come in and inspect the weight of the cooler, and the engineer wrote a letter explaining that construction must be done to the foundation of the building to hold the cooler.

The landlord gave my dad the responsibility for the construction. My dad agreed to pay and schedule everything, but the earliest it can be done is next year in the spring. However, the landlord wanted the construction done earlier - Now my dad is being sued for not getting the structure done sooner, and threatened an eviction by the end of next month.

They were upright and empty as the garbage truck had come by two hours before and did our street. The cans were blocking me in so I moved them to the back of my son's car so he wouldn't have to deal with them when he left for work later.   
The cans were not mine. There were used and filthy. There were no numbers on them to indicate where they came from. I did not want to be late for work so I dealt with it later.  I asked all of my surrounding neighbors if they were missing any and they weren't.I had planned to call the garbage company to have the cans picked up but my work day was chaotic and I just didnt have the time.  The day progressed and I forgot about them. Fast forward to today, 2 men pounded on my door in a rage claiming I stole their trashcans. I had forgotten about the cans as they sit behind my son's huge truck. He leaves after me and comes back home before I do so I don't see them in the corner. 

I asked them where they lived and they were several houses down and across the street. When I asked why they were on my property, they said they had guests over and needed the parking but also needed their trash emptied so they pushed them down the street until they found an empty spot, my driveway. I told them I did not mean to take them, they were in my way and simply moved them out of the way with the intent to find them a home, not knowing their home was 7 houses down the block. I told them they can have them back but they are demanding money. Our garbage pick up is free, paid for by our taxes, there is no extra cost. New cans are replaced free of charge if damaged and cleaning is provided once per year. They called police and police gave me a warning against the theft of the cans.

After a few months of living here our upstairs tenants started doing things that lead us to making a few noise complaints. The company kept telling us to just deal with it, so we gave up and put up with it until this month when my roommate had it and made a new noise complaint in some admittingly heated language. A few days later we get a letter stating that WE are harassing and/or bullying the tenants when we've done nothing of the sort, because we're the only ones making complaints and that they've lived here longer than us. If we were to continue complaining about said neighbor we would be evicted. Needless to say, we've completely given up on said neighbor.

What can the company actually do in this situation? Is calling us harassers for making noise complaints legal? This will also connect to the next paragraph.

Now some new tenants moved into a different apartment in the building. They're smoking weed, which as far as I know is illegal. The smell is triggering migraines and stomach aches in my roommate and I. The lease says to not make smells that offend other tenants. We called about it and they said ""We'll deal with it."" In the past they've said the same thing about other stuff and never did anything. 

Can they add this to their claim of harassment and try to evict us? I'm worried about this as we're not really in a position to move right now. We will try to move ASAP though because of all this.

This whole story started maybe 4.5 years ago around the time of the past election. As an independent and strong believer of the vote for the lesser evil, I had posted up some vote for Hillary signs at my house in hopes of persuading some people on the fence to vote with me. Well, let’s just say this little event may have resulted in the complete downward spiral of my life.

Not long after posting these signs on the front yard maybe two or three days after, I found them completely smashed and broken all over my yard. Luckily, my parents had installed cameras due to a prior incident of an attempted home invasion. After going through the blurry camera footage I saw what looked like my neighbors truck pulling up near my front house, and a shadowy figure getting out and smashing my signs with a bat. This was done during the night approximately 3:04 AM if I recall correctly. Obviously the cameras weren’t of the best quality, and I couldn’t be 100% sure it was him but there was a great gut feeling that it was him as he was a diehard conservative according to my father. I decided to get some small revenge a short time after and took down his Trump flags in the night. Now at this point I realize I acted stupidly because although I was sure it was him there was no way I could actually confirm it based on the blurry video. However, my suspicions were confirmed when he came over to my house and confronted me about the flags. I have no idea how he knew it was me, though I’m pretty sure his residence also contains cameras. I showed him the video of him destroying my yard signs and said an eye for an eye, to which he denied being in the video. I thought his reaction was genuine so I apologized greatly and gave him his flags back. I thought everything was okay but that changed after Trump won the election. He came over pretty drunk the night Trumps victory had been called and demanded to speak to me to which he said something along the lines of “how’s that boot taste you Marxist”. I promptly asked him to leave and was quite angry to be honest, about 15 minutes after he left the house he started shooting off an array of fireworks. I called the cops still mad at our encounter to file a noise complaint. Soon after the cops had left his house he fired a singular firework at my house, I guess he must have seen me looking through the window as it was aimed right at it.

It felt like a declaration of war. He would do small things like make his dog shit on our front yard to which I would reply by throwing food on his roof (inspired by Breaking Bad). Eventually there was a stalemate, I had seen his kid (I’m guessing he’s around 9) cleaning up the roof one time and I felt bad and I guess we both just stopped. That was, until Trump v Biden. Again, I had posted signs fully in favor of Biden, this time sure of my candidate. A week passed and my signs were destroyed. I checked the camera footage, this time there was no refuting it, with the addition of some night lights the cameras worked better. It was my neighbor. I thought about going to the police but decided to handle it on my own, I stole my neighbors flags again but this time I had no thought of giving them back. I put a bunch of Biden 2020 stickers all over my neighbors truck and went home satisfied. That was until I awoke a few mornings later and discovered my car had been keyed. I was enraged, I planned on staying up until he got home and beating the shit out of him. His kid was home apparently as I saw him walk his dog around the neighborhood, then I saw him stop on my front yard from my bedroom window. I knew what was about to happen and broke off in a dead sprint before this kids chihuahua shat on my lawn, I can only imagine the fear this now 12? Year old kid was feeling as he saw me sprint full speed at him. It was like I blacked out I couldnt control my rage and before I knew it I was in the air and drop kicked the neighbors kid. Luckily he was not hurt, but lets just say I won our little war.

What on earth do I do from here? Luckily he is not pressing charges because i threatened to show the police my photo and video evidence of his crimes

Once I met with my lawyer he cleared up so many things. I had no claim on the equity in the house or the savings account because my husband inherited those before we were married. The good news for me was that his eviction of me was indeed illegal as one of the replies said, so he will have to provide me some compensation for that. I'll also be compensated for some of the items in the house because he sold those behind my back even though they were joint assets. His bankruptcy won't affect me at all which is good. I've also found a new job with good pay and a place to stay I'm out of the shelter. I'm living in Nebraska closer to my family. Things are going much better for me than when I last posted. 

My original post was [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/numsr9/my_husband_filed_for_bankruptcy_because_of_crypto/)

&gt;I'm in the early steps of getting a divorce. My case has been accepted by an organization that gives lawyers to people with low income. I'm waiting to be assigned a lawyer. But I have a question now and I'm wondering if anyone can help or knows the answer. My location is Texas.

&gt;Like my title says, my husband has filed for bankruptcy. I found out he was lying to me about finances. I honestly thought he was having an affair because of how off he was acting. When I asked him about it he admitted to an affair but I found out that's a lie and he just said it so I wouldn't ask more questions. He didn't file for bankruptcy until after he got served with divorce papers.

&gt;He called the sheriff because I wouldn't leave and the sheriff said I had to because he inherited the house from his uncle before we got married so it isn't mine. So I had to leave or get arrested. Besides some equity from the house my husband also spent all the savings money from his uncle on crypto currency, stocks and other bad investments. He has no finance background so I have no idea how this started. I feel like an idiot for not knowing. Aside from the house and the savings account we had another bank account with a thousand or so in it for everyday purchases. We have no other assets. No credit cards or other accounts.

I am asking if there is any kind of case here and, if I may, where to go to get help.

Last May, I fell and seriously broke my wrist. Dr G (ER Dr.) set the wrist, but, knowing our family has a preferred Ortho, he did not make any suggestions and only used a temp splint. Dr. Rm (1st Ortho) put me in a cast after a full week in the splint - caused pain, and basically ignored me when I told him something was very wrong. After the cast came off, I noticed the wrist was significantly deformed (can supply images for serious queries in PM). I also had instability and subluxes. 

Dr R (Good Ortho) came into it in Sept. He had me do two surgeries - Dec 1 and 27 Apr. These were to stabilise the joint and fix the broken ligament (Dec - Dr Rm missed it snapped) and lengthen the bone that was compacted (Apr.). After recovery, I am still very unstable and in pain which I wasn't before, despite instability. 

Dr R is not in the wrong - he is really, really trying his best to fix the danger that Dr RM did by ignoring my statements that something was wrong and not performing enough tests. The issue is that the two Drs share the same practice and even offices within the parent Novant Health.

I have a downstairs neighbor who keep calling cops ""anonymously"" about noise complaints on me and my son.  At first it seemed justified, once it was really late, we had the tv on loud and having fun, and another time was like sure, the tv was on a bit loud after hours....however, I've had the tv on loud after hours a lot without cops knocking on my door, so it was a bit unusual.  


However lately, I'm getting cops called on for noise complaints earlier in the night, and my son is tucked in bed and what-not.  I left postets with my number to the two neighbors below me to call or text if they ever think we are being too loud, they never did that.  Last night around 10pm, when my son and I were already comfortably in our rooms a cop came again about a noise complaint. I mentioned to that cop my son was in bed and I don't remember him being excessively loud or anything. We agreed that I tucked him around the time the cop got the complaint, but that makes even less sense, and I explained how am I supposed to know what it is exactly what we are doing that makes the neighbor think we are being too loud when they want to stay ""anonymous"" with no direct communication? At the minimum I can at least inform him/her ""look, you got the wrong apartment number"" if that's the case. And I mentioned to the cop about the postets to which the cop's reply was, ""well, maybe it carries through to one of the other apartments without the postet notes...."", and that seemed far-fetched.  However, the cop said, ""you know it's not at after hours blah, blah, blah"" and the cop made it sound like it's not that big of a deal.  


And tonight, at 7:30pm, I hear angry stomping through the floor (you know, usually the type of stomping you want the person above you to shut up?), my son was lying on the couch and I, on my computer, so I turned the tv down, angry stomping again, turned it even more down to a murmur, and still MORE angry stomping. So if I get woken up and bother by cops again, I'm about to file my own noise complain for their stupid stomping that disturbs our peace. But I don't want to stoop down to the complainer's level.  


I sent my landlord a few emails about this because I don't know how to get this resolved; how they perhaps have the wrong apartment, I don't know or what.

CA law states that if the tenant backs out of the rental agreement, the landlord may keep a ""reasonable"" (i.e. ""all"") amount of the deposit. However, if the landlord ends up rejecting the tenants application, they must return the entire deposit.

Based on this law, I am inclined to try to get my application rejected. Here are some potential options: tell my landlord I got fired, or that I have bed bugs, or get one of my references to say I'm a psychopath. Can anybody see any drawbacks to proceeding with this plan? As far as I can tell, this would not be illegal. If the landlord takes the bait, I get my deposit back. If they call my bluff, then I'm in the exact same position I was before.

I don't have any of that. I've never done this before. When my grandmother put together these documents we thought that was all she needed to do.

Now that she's dead, what steps do I need to take? Do I need to create a trust for her? How do I create a trust? How do I get a tax ID for the trust? Do I need an EIN?

If I am a beneficiary on her life insurance policies and retirement accounts, do I need to go through a trust? Or will that just go directly to me? Also, I need to take over the mortgage. I'm not listed on the deed but am listed in her will as beneficiary and the property is to be distributed to me via the trust document. Can I just bring the trust paperwork to the mortgage lender or do I need something else?

He replied with an insane amount of defensive fury, a litany of angry emails and text messages and a notice that he would be filing a lien and lawsuit for nonpayment as retaliation for my criticism. I requested multiple times in writing and voicemails to provide an invoice so I could promptly pay in full and he repeatedly ignored my requests. How could I pay if I was given no invoice or method of payment??

The next day he “calmed down,” apologized and told me he would reduce the charges by $600. I wrote a check for the adjusted amount with a receipt, photographed it, and had it delivered via certified mail to ensure that he couldn’t lie about not receiving the payment.

Is there any part of this that is legally ambiguous, or am I just overanalyzing this?

I drove over there and grabbed her wallet and walked over to the unit and locked it inside. Only leaving her with her license and keys plus the storage unit keys.

She tried to pull this line that she “doesn’t feel safe” in her own home.

On Monday of this week I unexpectedly received a subpoena to provide witness testimony in a civil action. A client I worked with for one year from summer 2018 to summer 2019 is suing another company on IP-related grounds and that company’s defense subpoenaed me. 

The video call was today (Wednesday) and I attended without a lawyer. The deposition ended up lasting 5 hours and while I can confidently say I answered every question as truthfully as I could, I still feel uncomfortable about the entire thing. I did not anticipate the interview to last as long as it did, and I have a vague impression that the defense thinks I’m more involved than I am, was, or ever want to be. I also simply could not remember a lot of the conversations and events they wanted to ask about because it was years ago. 

On top of all of that, my previous client, who I had not spoken with in two years until this week, has sent me a number of emails this week that I do not know what to do with. I had replied to his initial email asking basic questions regarding the subpoena, such as how to join the call and how long I could expect it to be. I also contacted the lawyer listed on the subpoena and ultimately got that info from them. My old client sent me a number of emails the following day (Tuesday). One or two were in response to my questions, but others, some of which I chose to not even read after seeing the preview, seemed to include various rambling and possibly even guidance/tips of some sort for my deposition itself. One email was simply me getting CC’d to what appeared to be an email to his own lawyers complaining about some sort of issue he had in one of his own interactions with the defense. I did not ask to receive any of this, I don’t want it, and I’m not sure if it exposes me to legal liability or may give the appearance that I am working with him in any way. 

Simply put, I do not want any more involvement in this case. I have nothing to gain from this case one way or the other, but I do have a lot to lose in legal fees (If I do hire a lawyer) and possibly in the (Seemingly equally likely) event of either party in the lawsuit coming to the conclusion that I am somehow working with the other. I’m obviously out of my depth here but I did not anticipate this would develop in the way it has. I’ve already lost a full day of work on my current contracts and I am frustrated that now I may have to pay even more in legal fees. I’m also not sure if I am overreacting, since as of right now all I have done is provide witness testimony to the defense in a civil case. But I’m really uncomfortable with all of this, especially the emails I mentioned in the previous paragraph. 

So that is my situation and I really just have two questions. Am I overreacting or should I get a lawyer? And if I should get a lawyer, I would appreciate suggestions on what kind. I have looked through my city’s CBA listing but I’m not even sure what category this scenario falls under.",legaladvice,I am a freelancer who was unexpectedly subpoenaed to provide (and provided) witness testimony in deposition related to a client I had 2 years ago.

We have 2 dehumidifiers and 3 air purifiers. They help a bit but everything is so musty still. 

How can I get out of my lease?

I live in Colorado, she lived in California. I had just been laid off, so had no way to get out there, and may have been unable to due to restrictions anyway. She died soon after the diagnosis. 

As soon as my grandmother got the bad news, my estranged parents came out of the woodwork. They had apparently been living out of a van for several years until then. After she died, they essentially squatted in her home for months afterwards.

My grandmother's estate is as follows:

A home in Colorado
Her home in California
Some smaller bank balance (I believe my mother cleared most of it out before her death)
A used car, worth about 5k

According to her will, proceeds from the Colorado home were to be split between my mother and my uncle. The California home, which had a reverse mortgage, was to be split the same way, but only after my sister and I received a flat amount from the proceeds.

Obviously this was a hell of a time to deal with matters such as these, so it was understood that it would take a while to get a court date etc. I had no experience in this area, and the executor assigned was a friend of my grandmother's.

In May, the executor found legal representation as fiduciary. The attorney requested we sign a waiver of bond. Having little understanding and limited capability of traveling out of state, we all eventually complied. The executor's wife is a realtor and wanted to handle the sale personally. I assumed everyone was acting in good faith so I didn't protest.

The attorney reached out, saying they would file for ex parte to sell the CA house while awaiting a probate hearing date. Shortly afterwards, we signed a NOPA allowing the house to be listed. At this time communication was pretty open between the beneficiaries, the law office, the executor, and his wife who was handling the sale. 

The house closed in November. Once the sale was complete, I received no further updates for a while, and was largely preoccupied on keeping myself off the streets. I reached out to the executor in April requesting an update. He responded that we were looking at a court date in about a month. I'd heard that before a few times at this point. I've reached out to him since and haven't heard back.

Two weeks ago, I received word that my father had died. At this point it became apparent that the funds from the sale of my grandmother's house in Colorado had been distributed among my mother and uncle months beforehand. My sister and I had been left out of months of correspondence between my uncle, my mother, and the attorneys regarding the sale and distribution of the proceeds of my grandmother's home in Colorado. We only found out it had been sold by searching the address on Zillow. While I had no stake in this property per the will, I found this disturbing.

Upon learning funds and been partially distributed, my sister and I both reached out to the law office that represents the executor to provide any kind of update and preferably an accounting. Their response is as follows:



""There is no court date this month or any court date scheduled as of now – so not sure where that information came from.  

(Executor) is marshaling the last few assets and combining them into the one estate account then we will be ready to finalize the petition to close the estate shortly.  When we file and get a court date, a notice of that petition with its hearing date plus the accounting will be sent to you.

The Colorado property is separate and as I understand the net proceeds has been distributed, with a reserve to pay last bills associated with the Colorado property.

Let me know if you have any further questions.""

My sister cc'd the executor and responded as such:


""Thank you so much for your prompt response and for the helpful information, we certainly appreciate being able to verify these things with you rather than rely on the assumptions or misunderstandings of others.

With that being said, (Executor) – I hope you don’t mind me looping you in - would you be able to provide me with a quick update on the activities (Attorney) mentioned below to give us some situational awareness on the matter (e.g., what assets are left to be combined, their status, etc.)?""

It's been over a week and nothing from him or anyone else. I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm sure courts have been backed up. I'm sure he received plenty of harassment and accusations from both my mother and uncle. But the lack of transparency and communication is concerning to me at this point.

Does this sound fishy to you? I'm hoping someone can shine some light on this for me. Do I have a right to more transparency here? Or am I left in the dark since the attorney represents the executor as fiduciary and not me as beneficiary? I'm also wondering if there's any point to requesting a fiduciary bond at this point, or if there's any way to put pressure on the executor to resume communication.

In all fairness, I had a gun pointed at me and repeatedly asked if I could call a lawyer for advice.  Long story short, I got three years probation and 12 months of an IID.  This past September, when getting the machine recalibrated, it had issues, so many, that I kept calling the company's customer service line to document the ""abort tamper"" error (no, I was not tampering, why would I do that?  I had to blow like... three times to start, etc.) and I asked the service center every month, and every month he said ""you'll be fine"", and neither one of us had any proof of the supposed notes that customer service took when I would call and complain.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to having been on probation for 32 out of the 36 months, and being on month 24 of having the device, and it was a really cold day.  Machine violated me at a .034 at 6:45 am and shut down/screen turned black.  I tried calling IT/customer service immediately, but they were not open for another 15 minutes, and that window to blow a second time had passed.  It was the dead of winter, wind chill was below freezing (which makes them malfunction,) and as I have now learned, my asthma medication could register as high as a .05.  It is important to note, that after bouts with pneumonia, I was advised that you should use your inhaler for maintenance/preventative medication on days you think you could be at risk for an attack (for me, freezing cold, sinus infections, etc.)   It could have been that, it could have been hand sanitizer (it was at the height of a surge, I live in an apt building, and I'm a teacher,) my mints, the fact I have PCOS and was menstruating, thus heightening my hormonal issues and hormone resistance?  I don't know.  I know I had not imbibed, and if I had any clue as to what caused this to happen, it would not have happened. Unfortunately, I was not drug tested, which would be irrefutable scientific proof that could acquit me.  Anyway, when the car got serviced, the mechanic approached me and said ""I'm going to replace it"" and I have the receipt as proof that he replaced it.  He refuses to say it was replaced due to a malfunction, and the judge wanted the paperwork to say ""replaced due to malfunction"" to dismiss it.

I hired a lawyer and she's terrible.  Her latest?  Instead of getting documentation the judge requested by having him sign an affidavit, pulling reports through probation to show there were 257 abort tamper errors in the month leading up to the malfunction, she tried to negotiate a plea deal, thus incriminating me.

I called another local service center, got the proof I needed in a taped phone call (legal in my state if one party is aware,) and he provided what I need in writing.  I have a hearing with 30 days hanging over my head and an unresponsive and ineffective lawyer, as well as a judge that is biased and literally said ""she drank alcohol""... I did not.

The next day when this continued I went to my local store and inquired the problem. They told me that I had cancelled my service and ported the number to another provider.

That was the last time I saw the inside of my account. June 10th

In the next two weeks I managed to recover my stolen email. Where I read a message from coinbase telling me the account had been locked down due to suspicious activity. Then messages from the hacker pretending to be me saying it was all a mistake and to unlock the account.

  I then emailed coinbase customer support telling them that I had recovered my phone number and email and that I was able to provide with anything they needed to unlock the account. Their response was that I had already emailed about this matter and that is would take 4-5 days to review.  7 days go by I email them again. I get the same 4-5 day response (there is no phone number to call). another week goes by I email them again pleading. Again nothing. So I filed a formal complaint. Their response was that it would take 10-15 business days to review my complaint. 15 days later they me that my issue would require and additonal 20 days of review. Today is day 21. Nearly 3 months after finding out that the money that was going to change my life had probably been stolen. This company doesn't even had the decency to respond to an email, or give me a phone call.

I was wrongfully terminated in late-July, following a disagreement with my co-worker. After making a mistake, I attempted to explain the situation and teach my co-worker (still fairly new) about how to properly handle the situation. She refused to communicate, and would instead yell, interrupt me, or just storm away any time I would try to engage. I said ""If you're not willing to communicate to solve the problem, I think maybe you should leave"". I immediately followed up with the supervisor, who agreed with my decision and said he would have done the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next 2 weeks, there was a lengthy HR battle between myself and the department manager over the situation. She said I did not have the authority to send my co-worker home, even though another employee had been given that authority over his partner, for minor reasons such as ""I think he's annoying"". The next shift, my manager was waiting for me in the hall. She said, ""As of right now, you will be back on a 12-hour shift. You will work 12 hours tonight, and then come in an hour early tomorrow for a 'conflict resolution meeting' "". I contacted HR and my temp agency, and asked for someone to sit-in during the meeting as a neutral party to prevent any biased decisions from being made by the manager, as I have reason to believe there is some favoritism at play due to the manager knowing the co-worker's family personally, outside of work. The meeting was cancelled, and I was issued a verbal warning for ""aggressive behavior and harassment"" when the manager's attempt to have me fired was denied.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, I was called on my day off and informed that I had been terminated on the grounds of harassing multiple other employees the night before. This is false, so I spent a long time on the phone with my temp agency trying to figure out what I could do. I explained that I would like to pursue legal action if possible for; Wrongful termination, retaliation for whistleblowing (calling out nepotism and favoritism), harassment, defamation of character, and of course emotional distress/ hardship.

&amp;#x200B;

I was finally contacted (almost a month later) by the HR representative of my temp agency, at the company headquarters in California. I live in Washington State. After a long conversation, she has confirmed that she will be launching a formal investigation into the circumstances of my termination. She asked me what kind of compensation I was hoping to get out of this, but I'm really not sure how to determine that. I have never had to deal with this much of a disaster in the workplace before, so I really don't know what I could even get out of this whether it be a lawsuit or a settlement. My question now is, what might be reasonable compensation for a situation like this? If it does go to court, would I be able to also sue for compensation of my lawyer/court fees? I'm supposed to be coming up with an answer for the next time I speak with the HR woman. Here's what I'm thinking so far

1. Lost wages between date of termination and date of new employment
2. Defamation of character (multiple false/baseless claims of harassment)
3. Emotional hardship/distress
4. Lawyer/court fees (IF it goes that far)

What else should or could I be compensated for? Feel free to ask questions for clarification if needed.

\- Bats have been found inside the house.

We contacted a pest control company and they contracted with an insulation company to replace the insulation after they did the exclusion.  


Install day and an insulation guy (IG) fell through our ceiling, causing damage to two rooms. That was fixed at no cost, but a month or so later the electricity went out in our sun room, the electrical plug in the garage ceiling, and a plug on the outside wall of the sun room.   


It took a few different electricians to locate the issue, but it was found that there were multiple open electrical junction boxes and exposed wiring in the attic where the work was done, and as far as the electrician determined the short was likely due to insulation getting into the box and the wiring, however, the electrician said the insulation would need to be removed from the area to safely trace and fix the issue. Also, I was advised that this was a fire hazard and had to be fixed as soon as possible.  


I contacted the pest control company, since they had contracted the insulation company and we were able to get the insulation company out at no cost. They removed the insulation today and I thought everything was fine. Just a few moments ago I discovered that the lights in my kitchen and dining room, the rooms they pulled insulation from, no longer work. They worked this morning before the IG's arrived.   


The electrician is scheduled for tomorrow, and I'm going to ask him to write up something showing the issues and his determination for the cause of the sudden outages.

Parents moved into their house 22 years ago in lower Michigan (in the imgur link, Lot 3 in the map, highlighted in green).  There was a fence that was up around the property at the time of sale. At one point my parents put up new fence panels as the old ones had deteriorated in the same place.  4-5 years after living there a shed was built on the property, so that has been there now \~18 years?

&amp;#x200B;

Within the past month or two the owner of Lot 2 had the land zoned for preparation to sell, but rudely verbally told my parents that their fence and shed were over her lines (\~2 months ago).  The lot had been vacant and quasi maintained parts of Lot 2 over the past 22 years as it becomes overgrown.  Never in that time have they ever encountered the owner until just 2 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The owner sent the certified survey of the property along with a notification that the fence was over the property by 6.9', and the shed was 1.8' over the property line and they had 30 days from the date of that letter to have it moved or it would be moved over by the owner of Lot 2.   This was delivered August 18th, but dated August 4th.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents hearts sunk to their guts naturally, as they don't know if it is even possible to find someone to move the 12x24' shed, not to mention ripping the fence out on top of that.    At least with the timeframe given.  I've been trying to assist my father today trying to find someone to help us move it (hes older). 

&amp;#x200B;

With the little timeframe that they have, they are full on willing to do what they have to do to make things right as they were completely unaware.  The owners of Lot 2 are not reasonable, or they could have just asked... and showing how rude they were my parents don't want to reach out to them just yet as they don't think it will get them anywhere.  

&amp;#x200B;

Legally speaking, I didn't know if they have any options regarding the short-term notice.  And moving something that quickly, I dont know how feasible it is.  

&amp;#x200B;

Link to letter and map.  These were delivered August 18th, 2021, delivered via certified mail.

&amp;#x200B;

I am clueless on what to do.  I am trying to help my father and mother by calling the few random places that may or may not be able to move it...and try to do it within this timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

If ANYONE knows if there are any options here I would love to try and understand.  My mother called me bawling her eyes out today.  And I know my dad is so overwhelmed seeing this as well.

California

**The Incident:**  
About 30 minutes ago as I coming back from the store about 10 teenagers (~13-16 year olds) were slowing riding their bikes down a residential street in my neighborhood. Most of them got out of the way as my car approached (~10-15 mph) but two stayed in front and one popped a wheelie in front of my car for about 5-10 seconds. I honked my horn and the guy doing the wheelie waved to indicate i should just drive around him. I had no intention of trying to drive around a kid doing a wheelie on his bicycle so i just honked again and thats when a third kid came up behind my car and screamed at it. 

At this point I definitely become an asshole and I roll my window down and start yelling at them as I slowly creep down the street while they block me on their bikes. 

Most of the kids scatter when i start yelling but the first kid doing a wheelie pulls up and starts arguing ""why are you getting mad were driving bikes in a residential area?!"". At that point I had already reached my house so I pulled into the drive way and the kid rode off on his bike.

I fully acknowledge that rolling down my window and yelling at them was the wrong move and i shouldn't have done it. It only made the situation worse and regret doing it since it was both very unsafe and unhelpful.

**Why I'm Here:**  
I'm concerned the teenagers might come back and vandalize my property at night (another regret I have for yelling at them).

Hello,

I have a 2014 Chevrolet Cruze LT 1.4L. I had the turbo charger replaced on it (under warranty thankfully) back in September of 2019. I took my car in for a routine service (to the same dealership that replaced the turbo) and did a standard 105k mile service package, but also opted to do a fuel induction service to perhaps help clean any carbon buildups I might have.

After the service, I hopped in my car to head home and not even 2 minutes down the road the check engine light came on (it was not on before I took it to the shop and I had not had any issues with the car beforehand). It was running like crap so I turned around and took it back to the dealership and told them the check engine light was on and it was running terribly. They cleared the code, I believe they said it was a P0300 Engine Misfire or something of that degree. Claimed it was from the chemicals not having burned all the way off properly. Then I left and the check engine light came back on 2 minutes down the road again. Took it back, tried to charge me to replace some bypass valve, ended up getting it paid for and not having to pay and the advisor said he test drove the car and it was all good to go, no codes. Got out on the road, same thing check engine light on and bad performance. I called the advisor and told him it came on again and that I would have to bring it back tomorrow (today) as I had already spent the entire day at the dealership. So today they get into it and it throws P0299 Turbo Underboost which I am quite familiar with as that is what it threw back when I had to get it replaced (these cars are notoriously bad for faulty turbos). The issue here is that they're trying to charge me to replace the turbocharger and saying they are not going to pay for it. I am not really sure what I can do as this seems like they clearly messed something up while my car was in their shop. It doesn't seem fair that I should have to pay for the repairs for something they likely induced or caused. It is so unlikely that the turbocharger just up and failed 2 minutes off of the lot without them having messed something up. This turbo is less than 2 years old.... It's turning into the finger pointing and my word vs theirs and I feel like my word doesn't win that fight :(

TL;DR  
Took my perfectly working car to the shop for a routine service and came out of the shop screwed up and the dealership trying to hit me for turbo charger replacement which probably runs close to a G in price.

Reaching out to this sub because I’m frankly livid with my employer over the company’s treatment of another employee. We work at a non-profit and being out in the community is a necessary feature; one of my coworkers ended up getting a breakthrough case of COVID. Instead of letting her work from home (which could have been done during quarantine), they made her use PTO.

It makes my angry at a baseline that we are frontline workers and aren’t being protected by our employer when things like this happen; but what really set me off was reading about the FFRCA. How did mandatory time off work with the bill? I assume it was classified as something separate from PTO? I know the bill is ‘optional’ for 2021, but employers can adhere to it for tax credits. Fat chance my cheapskate employer didn’t end up taking those if offered. My question is this: assuming they did claim the credits, would this PTO policy be tax fraud? And if it is, is there anyway I can find out if they did indeed claim the credits?

I live in Washington. My little sister is 14 and will be spending the school year with me. My mom has agreed to signing a temporary guardianship form but is taking her sweet time.

I am trying to get her caught up on these things. But I can’t do any of it without my mom signing a million things. Which is impossible. 

I want to ask my mom for full custody and if she is willing to give it to me I have a few questions that I can’t find a straight answer to. 

1) is her giving away custody the same as giving up her rights? 

2) can she give away custody to me without going through a lawyer is she is willing to do it. 

3) I read somewhere that she would still have to pay child support by state law. Is that true? 

4) can we just right up our own custody agreement and have it notarized.

During that time I used sick-days but still did several hours of work from home to make sure important and timely stuff was taken care of in the several days after my surgery. My doctor's orders during this week was to wear my boot/cast 100% of the time and to lay down as close to 100% of the time as possible, and to put zero weight on my broken leg, and ice, all day, every day. You get the idea. Of the few things I could do was be on my computer doing work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding my work: I'm salaried. I work at a desk in an office on the computer almost entirely. All of my work can be done remotely, outside of a handful of things that can be addressed with help from coworkers. I can remotely operate my work computer. Despite this, I go into work 5 days a week (pre-injury) and have been since covid19 lockdown.

&amp;#x200B;

When my surgery was over I was well drugged and was told to not do any official communication until the drugs wore off (about 24 hours). I was also told to do the same thing that I wrote above for at least 4 weeks. I was given a doctor's note for my employer that reads: ""\[name\] is able to work with the following restrictions: From surgery on \[date\] through 6 weeks after surgery, able to work from home. Able to work 5 days per week from home. Will re-evaluate at follow up in 4 weeks. Work activity released signed on behalf of \[doctor\]"", plus some other stuff not relevant. Now, every single step along the way my boss (and others) was informed, starting the night of the break, by email (preferred that so that I have things in writing). He emailed me after I sent him a copy of the doctor's note saying something along the lines of 'approved for 1 day at home, 4 days in the office'. Which clearly isn't possible. Even if I ignored doctor's orders, I was in immense pain and it was significantly worse if I sat in a chair or stood up on crutches. Oxycodone helped a little, but not much, and I don't want to pound those if I can avoid it. Working in the office is physically impossible. I, of course, strongly pushed back on this and he hinted (over the phone so not in writing), but wasn't explicate, that it would change my pay/benefits. He then argued semantics and said that the doctor's note only said I was able to work from home, not unable to work in the office. So I contacted my doctor and got a new note that had the following change: ""... able to work 5 days a week from home but not allowed to go into or work in the office..."". I sent my boss the new note and he then approved me for 4 days working from home. After a little back and forth with him copying the payroll person and CFO, he ended up saying that I would get paid for 4 days work, not 5. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I am absolutely capable of a full days work, 5 days a week. His justification for only allowing 4 paid days was that I wasn't able to do the work that needed to be done in the office, which isn't anywhere close to 8-9 hours in a day, and can be assisted with by other employees willing to help. The fact is that less work will get done based on his decision and I will be paid less even though I'm salaried. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it's important, my immediate boss, the person referenced above, is the founder/owner/CEO/president of the company. We're a small company and don't have an HR person.

His business and land is in Puerto Rico so I went there and dealt with a lawyer to get everything transferred to us. 

He got back to me and said it will take 3-4 months minimum but more like 6 months to finish everything.

I understand all situations are different especially in Puerto Rico compared to the U.S.. Is half a year normal though?

Is it more to do with the lawyer itself so maybe another can get it done sooner?

Our main concern is that a storm and/or people in the area can destroy the property within that time. Apparently the building on the land has had it's copper ripped out once before for example.

If there's anything anyone can suggest for possibly moving things along faster I'd appreciate hearing it.

My aunt began living there full time and has lived there since. No issues with neighbour's during that time.

May 2021: 
New neighbour's moved in. Immediately there was problems. They ripped down a privacy vine growing on the fence between the two properties. The male (we'll call him George) trespassed onto my aunt's property and began sawing off a tree limb without permission. There was a yelling match as a result; however my aunt and mom did not contact police because they thought it could be resolved peacefully. I told my mom and aunt to contact police if not at least file a police report to make authorities aware of the situation.

More time passed...

The female (We'll call her Katrina), started screaming at my mom over the fence one day and slamming a broom against her own house in a threatening manner. I told my mom to contact police but she did not.

More time passed...

My mom was on our property picking raspberries when Katrina started screaming at her again. She then went on a tirade of lies and started calling my mom a racist. (Katrina and George are Filipino immigrants PR status). Katrina called police and lied to them telling them my mom said to go back to her country. Police followed up and basically said ""she called first"". After this I told my mom and aunt to record every interaction on video. They did not.

Not long after...

Katrina started screaming at my mom again, about my aunt's dog ""shitting on the lawn all the time"" (ours, not theirs) calling the town bylaw officer on my mom stating ""the dog just shits everywhere and it's not picked up"". The bylaw officer followed up and no problems were found. The next day the neighbour's installed security cameras and pointed them at our family property.

At this point I told my mom and aunt to get a restraining order against George and Katrina. They did not.

Most recently...

I got a call from my mom while she is at work stating ""I've just been served with a restraining order from Katrina, she lied and said I threatened to shoot her. I think I should go to the RCMP detachment now."" 

So reddit, things have escalated insanely like I've known they would. I'm pretty sure the neighbour's are trying to force my aunt and mom to lose the property so they can flip it. My family is not racist and have even been close with the Filipino community in town for many years. Nor is my mom the type to scream serious threats or any threats for that matter. I understand that their inaction has brought this on to themselves. However it's gone too far and if they won't take control of the situation, I will. 

What kind of legal recourse can be taken in this situation. Is it as hopeless as it seems? Is it illegal to point a surveillance camera directly at our property? Can Katrina be sued for slander regarding the false threat call?

I'm located in CA. Not sure what flair is appropriate here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my wife and I went on a trip to Nice, France. While there we rented a car from Sixt Rent A Car located at the Nice Airport. We prepaid $574 to have the car for 48 hours (expensive yes but we wanted to splurge on a luxury convertible). 

&amp;#x200B;

The contract has 500 km included and additional km are charged at around $1.50/km. Two days after we returned the car (on time) we received an invoice for $13,919.59 stating we drove a total of 5,865 km. For my Americans that's 3,644 miles. Driving from California to Florida is only 2,706.4 miles. We'd have to drive 75 mph with no breaks for the entire 48 hour rental period to even accomplish that distance. We'd have to drive the entire border of France 1 and a 1/2 times. My wife emailed twice when the charge was pending on our account. Once the charge posted I called their corporate line and was told their customer service phone line was down and to email. I sent an email as directed. We've received no response to any emails.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I've already called Chase to proceed with a chargeback. Chase has said since its such a large amount they will have to escalate to a different team. My questions is, do you think we'll have any issue with the chargeback? Chase hasn't asked us for any evidence at this point but if necessary we have parking garage receipts and receipts from restaurants we ate at during the rental period all in Nice. Do you think it will be enough that the distance is almost physically impossible?

I got a voice-mail a few hours ago from the leasing office that our unit flooded while maintenance was installing the carpet in the bedroom, and that we won't be able to move in tomorrow, and to call them back as soon as possible. 
I stepped out and called 10 times, every single number I could find for the office, and I couldn't get ahold of anyone. My SO called 15 times and they were able to get ahold of someone who told us the issue happened because maintenance left the back door open while it was raining and the unit flooded, but it was minor. They said we could possibly move in at 5 pm instead of 9 am (which doesn't work for our work schedule, our internet installer, or our movers, none of which can be rescheduled without a fee on our part). Tomorrow is also the first day of the fall semester for both my SO and I, so this whole situation is already stressful. 
They still haven't returned my call, but they did talk to my SO, though it wasn't the leasing manager who had called me. I left work early and I'm on my way to the complex. I'm scared that they will try to pin damage on us, or give us a water damaged unit. They also didn't say anything about prorating rent (moving in Friday would have been $15 more a month in rent). 
What do I do or ask them, can I ask for a new unit if this one is damaged and they say it's not a big deal? I'm lost and panicked right now. We have to move out and the new time doesn't work, and I'm scared that our unit will flood every time it rains, or we'll be shut in the house unable to leave if it rains because opening a door will let all the water in. The unit is half underground, the front door is 6 steps below and the back door is level with the inner courtyard.
We signed the lease but haven't moved in yet. Getting out is 2 months rent, or 5 days of unlivable conditions without the issue being addressed. Complex still hasn't called me back and didn't give either of us alt options to navigate this situation.",legaladvice,Apartment complex flooded our unit and we're supposed to move in tomorrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p727ev/apartment_complex_flooded_our_unit_and_were/

   Someone on Craigslist offered to both meet up and or send me a package that we agreed to at 350 dollars since we were over an hour of eachothers way. 
     I send the money through zelle and the person ends up saying the money is being refunded due to the business account that money went into which was a chase account Which will take up to 3-5 days to process according to their bank. I’ve never seen a direct deposit payment being refunded before please correct me if I’m wrong. 
    They say they have other buyers willing to pay more and that if I want the package to send the original payment again which I’m apprehensive to do as this sounds like a scam. We agree to a tracking number and half the 350 until the original payment refunds so I can send the other half of the payment. 
    The person gives me a tracking number which is legit for a 1 day shipping label but it hasn’t updated and is in the pre-shipment phase for the past 3 days. They’re saying they dropped it off which I’m highly in doubt of. 
    The Craigslist listing has also been updated and not taken down since my “purchase” so I’m assuming they’re trying to scam more people. 
    I have this persons phone number address ect they haven’t ghosted me and respond.
     SO.... If the money doesn’t get refunded and this whole thing was a scam can I go to local authorities or where do I go to report fraud?

Please help me yall. 

I did an evaluation for substance abuse as directed by the court for probation, and I told the evaluator about my health issues, everything ive done to “heal” myself from my lifelong disease before getting on controlled medications, my pain and my disease and that I was on legally prescribed medications for my condition. I answered honestly on questions like “do you take a substance to function” “do you take substance because of pain” and I asked him to clarify because I simply take my prescribed medications to function and for pain, but I don’t drink alcohol or take cocaine,etc to function, like the test seemed to insinuate. 

The evaluator was terrible. He asked me my name and what I was arrested for 5 different times. He was very old, and it was like he had Alzheimer’s, he asked me the same exact questions every couple minutes like I hadn’t just told him the same thing multiple times. 

When I got done with the evaluation, he told me it came up high risk but he told me he didn’t agree with it, and told me I should have lied about certain questions because they were for alcohol/illegal drugs not medications, but I specifically asked him to clarify while I was taking the questionnaire. But he sent it to my PO anyways, and I meet my PO soon for the first time. So my PO now has a report saying I’m high risk when the guy told me directly that he doesn’t think I am and that I should have lied, and also told me I should go somewhere else to get a different evaluation done and not answer the way I did because I was saying I take my prescriptions to function, not illegal drugs/alcohol. 

I’ve spoke with one of my doctors who said he’s willing to go to bat for me and write a letter saying I should not be stripped of my controlled medications because they allow me to function and willing to speak to my character, but I fear that won’t be enough. 

I’ve also left a message with my attorney and am waiting to hear back. 

Anyone with advice, I would really really appreciate it. I truly need these medications to function and I’m terrified of what’s to come.

I've had this feeling/evidence of my boss having a vendetta against me. I've reported to her supervisors different evidence to support these claims. Well it all finally came to a head..

She visited the group home one day and I knew by her demeanor that she was out for blood. I started my audio recorder on my phone to have evidence of our interaction in case it went sour. 

She tells me to follow her from the office into a small room with one exit. I reach for my phone and she tells me to leave it on the desk. I protest a bit and she repeats to have me leave it. (Phone on desk and still recording) I follow her into the room where she shuts the door behind me. She reaches into a folder and pulls out a stack of paper which look like ""write-ups"" and asks me why a certain menial task wasn't completed yet. I told her that I was prioritizing items that were due sooner. She says ""This has been an ongoing problem, I have a slew of ""write-ups"" to give you and your first directive is to Shut Up"". 

I say something like nope and start to head for the exit. She gets in my way and bars me from leaving with her arm. I try to open the door and she slams it shut. I get it open enough to where I can squeeze out and she puts her arm across my chest when I try to duck under it. I'm yelling the whole time saying how fucked up this all is. I push through her arm and run into the office across the hall to get my phone and the house phone to try and figure out who I need to call. She follows me into the office and shuts the door. I say you can't lock me in a room. I get past her and start dialing her supervisors numbers. I go outside to try and contact someone and eventually they reach her and tell her to leave the premises. 

I go back inside to file an accident report and workplace violence while I wait for relief so I can go to the main office and speak with her boss. After relaying what happened, I go to the sheriff's office to file charges. A deputy takes my statement and a photo of my small injury(a brush burn on my inner elbow where she held me back from leaving the room) I press charges for 2nd degree harassment and 2nd degree unlawful imprisonment and request an order of protection.

The charges aren't presented to her for another 2 weeks. I then receive a call from a deputy saying that she was pressing charges against me. I relay that I've already pressed charges and that another deputy has all the evidence including the audio recording. He says that my story makes more sense. I haven't heard anything else on that matter nor have I been presented with charges.

My job is trying to place her on leave and she fights that for a workers comp case, saying that I injured her foot somehow.. Workers comp grants her case. Thing is, she was only 2 weeks away from retirement when this happened and then retired on workers comp stopping any administrative action. 

She then anonymously calls the number where one would report any form of abuse to the individuals and falsely charges me for neglect against them.

I get placed on administrative restrictions and a work location move pending the results of an investigation.

My doctor takes me out of work for an extended period of time citing emotional trauma and anxiety. Her criminal case has been adjourned to a later date for ""Information Discovery""

I have been out of work and using my accruals to continue receiving a paycheck and will blow through around $25k worth when my doctors note runs out. Not to forget mentioning the medical bills from seeing a counselor and increased physician visits.

Do I have a civil case against her to seek restitution for my accruals and medical bills? Along with the mental and emotional distress for pain and suffering caused? Also do I press charges for filing a false police report and retaliation at my current job site?

Someone on Craigslist offered to both meet up and or send me a package that we agreed to at 350 dollars since we were over an hour of eachothers way. 
     I send the money through zelle and the person ends up saying the money is being refunded due to the business account that money went into which was a chase account Which will take up to 3-5 days to process according to their bank. I’ve never seen a direct deposit payment being refunded before please correct me if I’m wrong. 
    They say they have other buyers willing to pay more and that if I want the package to send the original payment again which I’m apprehensive to do as this sounds like a scam. We agree to a tracking number and half the 350 until the original payment refunds so I can send the other half of the payment. 
    The person gives me a tracking number which is legit for a 1 day shipping label but it hasn’t updated and is in the pre-shipment phase for the past 3 days. They’re saying they dropped it off which I’m highly in doubt of. 
    The Craigslist listing has also been updated and not taken down since my “purchase” so I’m assuming they’re trying to scam more people. 
    I have this persons phone number address ect they haven’t ghosted me and respond.
     SO.... If the money doesn’t get refunded and this whole thing was a scam can I go to local authorities or where do I go to report fraud?

When I was living in my old apartment, I bought myself a fish to use to maintain a routine and because it is proven that fish can reduce symptoms of anxiety/depression. Well, it worked!

When I moved into my new apartment, my landlord told me (after multiple other issues with him) that if I wanted to move my 10 gallon aquarium in, I would have to pay a $900 pet deposit fee. The deposit is for carpet damage, animal urine/odors, damage to the walls; etc. my fish obviously can’t do any of this- he’s just being an asshole and retaliating against us (again-long story. I have a lawyer though). 

My therapist who I’ve been seeing for 6 years wrote me an ESA letter, providing proof that the fish alleviated symptoms of anxiety; a diagnosis I have had for 6 years. This is according to the diagnostic statistical manual and my own medical professional. 

I sent the ESA letter to my landlord. Now, I’m just wondering when I can move my fish into my apartment. He is a needy little guy, and I am a needy person. I’ve been stressing about him being in my old apartment all alone, and I just want him close to me again. (I love this fish - don’t judge)

Ordered a bunch of equipment direct from OEM back in mid March, \~$500. 

Items arrived a little later than expected and when I opened the box, I found no packing materials had been used and the items were damaged. Contacted the company. They claimed UPS had damaged original packaging and repacked. They offered a refund, or an RMA. 

I still needed the equipment so I opted for RMA. Box went back with the provided shipping label, tracking showed delivered with signature in good time. 

Weeks pass. Sent two emails, no response. Called, lines busy, left VMs, no contact. 

Finally call right at opening time and get ahold of a human. Cannot tell me why RMA has not been confirmed received but will look into it. No contact for another week, call repeatedly with no return contact. Finally get notified by email parts have been received and new parts will ship within a week.

Week and a few days later, still nothing. Call again, nobody knows what's wrong, no supervisors available to speak to even if I am willing to hold. Am repeatedly promised contact, never get it, not even email.

Call yesterday, get promised resolution callback with 24hrs, of course nothing.

Finally today, call again, get told the RMA dept didn't ship replacement parts and instead credited the card. Then they told me the amount and it was less than the total, they had charged me for the shipping. Had to complain about THAT. Said they would issue another refund. 

So my problems.

Problem #1 I *lost* that card July 4th and reported it as such and it was replaced. Don't know how much of a problem that is? After checking with the bank I have no transactions on that account for a credit, pending or otherwise, their email shows a transaction number.

Problem #2, I *need those parts*. The rest of the build was centered around them, or I'm going to have to purchase other things to make this work with new parts, on the order of another few hundred dollars.

I have the request for RMA vs refund in writing in an email chain, but aside from the refund, it's all I have in writing from them. All else was on the phone.

I asked him if the cops give him a tough time since he's on private property.

They may own the land, but instead of a trespassing issue, it's a 'right to free speech within public plazas' issue, so the store can complain - but legally, they can't prevent us from doing this here since Bock vs Westminster Mall. *big smile*""

Even though I was lied to, and I have proof that she did in fact falsify her age before any photos were exchanged, could I face any legal repercussions for this?

TLDR, they basically just stopped working, and after a loooot of back and forth, they now have proposed to finish everything to my satisfaction (at least the proposal sounds good) and have given me a date of Sept 10, 2021.  They want me to sign a Mutual Release of Claims, including the following language:

&gt;The claim or dispute occurred on or about July of 2021. It is indicated that {FIRM} has had significant delays in completing the project at the address listed above. Additionally, it is alleged that {FIRM} by way of an installation technician did perform work that was not in a workmanship manor, specifically in the main service panel and underground burial conductors.  
&gt;  
&gt;In consideration of conversation had by both parties, and the correction and completion of all work specified in {CONTRACT} no later than September 10, 2021, it is acknowledged that the Releasor and any and all agents, relatives or otherwise representatives releases and forever discharges {FIRM}, its owners, directors, officers, employees, agents, assigns, legal representatives and successors from all manner of actions, causes of action, debts, accounts, bonds, contracts, claims and demands for or by reason.

The question, in short, is, **in the event that they do the same thing as before (overpromise, under deliver, and miss this deadline) does this release restrict my ability to continue to go after them?**  Or would it be clear that we're stipulating that this release is based on the completion of the original contract by September 10th, and if they violate those terms, I wouldn't be expected to still release them of all claims? 

I'm not super familiar with this particular type of agreement, but it seems template-y and I wasn't sure if there are built in assumptions like ""if the agreement isn't met, then the release is considered null and void.""

I've also already proposed to them that I'd like to include specific language detailing what work needs to be completed, even though the contract basically outlines it.  I don't like ""in consideration of conversation"" because who's to say what we talked about.  The contract is kinda vague too, saying things like ""install circuits in the room,"" when I want to be clear ""circuits to be installed to code and GFCI as necessary in kitchen and bathroom.""  Previously, we had a great relationship, so I didn't care about details, but now after everything I wanted to add a bulleted list that includes more detail on what's to be done than the original contract, so it's obvious what we're agreeing should be done by the deadline.  Hoping they don't get weirded out by the specificity of my additions.

I genuinely don't care about the negative posting/NDA type lines, I could care less if they get more work as long as this job gets done finally.

I'm just trying to make sure I don't sign this thinking I'm finally getting what I want in writing and then find out I just released them prematurely and I'll never see them again.

More info about the situation, if it matters:

This work should probably have taken a small crew a solid week to finish.  They elected to try to squeeze it in smaller bursts, which I was initially okay with, but then things started to get weird and I'd get one guy out for like 2 hours on a Tuesday with no supplies and barely much work would get done.  Then they just kinda stopped.

October '20: Work went well but at some point in December, the work stalled out and I began having a hard time contacting the business.  This isn't a fly-by-night single crew, it's a multi-city company, and I think they overextended in growth and were having a hard time keeping things staffed in my market.  Mar '21: Regardless of the cause, I broke down and threatened legal action if they didn't refund an appropriate portion of the already paid funds ($2500) or finish the work within a month.  The owner personally responded and we reached a non-binding agreement (written, but not signed) that he'd finish the job by April.    
Apr '21: Date came and went, never really even made much of an effort, but did enough to keep me from getting mean again for a couple months.  
June '21: I finally get mean, actually look into getting counsel, find out it's better to go small claims, and basically spell out exactly how I'm going to go after my refund.  
July '21: He asks that we still try to settle out of court, and offers to come back out, review the work, make a list and set a date.  
Today: Finally, after a lot of delays, he's offered to finish by Sept 10th, 2021",legaladvice,Mutual Release of Claims - Giving up too much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p70xgy/mutual_release_of_claims_giving_up_too_much/

First of all my dad is not a criminal he's just a guy doing his best to provide for 2 families, working from 5am to 10pm every day.. A while back him and I were on our way to work and got pulled over, turns out we did not have insurance on the truck and the plates were out, so they impounded the vehicle (cop was a bit of a asshole but I get why he did it) that turned into him needing to go to court. 

Then covid hit and in Utah you had to do all hearing online. My dad did 2 court hearings online, both times he had to take off work. Now in these hearings both times (showing up 20 minutes early) he waited 3 1/2 hours for the judge to get to him. Both times they just ended the session and completely forgot about him. So finally some lady told him to ""just pay the fine and you should be good BUT we will need to do a third court date"". My dad said okay fine, but demanded that he do it in person so he doesn't have to deal with all that again, they agreed and set up the court date. He paid off $500 of a $700 fine, then finally went to court. 

Here's the messed up part. after getting to court the judge said ""do you think you're above the law? You missed 2 court dates! Do you think the law doesn't apply to you?"" Afterwards proceeds to ask my dad a question in BIG legal terms that my dad didn't understand. nervously he answered what he thought it meant. When he answered the judge got really mad and instantly said ""I'm sentencing you to 10 days in county jail bailiff get him out of my courtroom!""

My dad is probably the most calm person you'll ever meet, he was respectful the entire time and did everything in his power to get this resolved. He does not deserve what's happening to him in my opinion. Is there anything I can do to get him justice for this? I just don't think this is right and I feel like that judge was in a bad mood and took it out on him.

Hey everyone,

I'm a disabled veteran in Ohio receiving VA disability benefits &amp; Social Security disability. In 2018 I had the worst financial hardship of my life and it involved my home going into foreclosure and my leased vehicle being (wrongly) repossessed. In the end, I was able to save my home but I did not get my vehicle back. I have roughly $17k worth of debt ranging from old credit cards, non-VA medical, AT&amp;T (which is another $6k nightmare story), etc. that racked up because of this hardship.

I recently received a court summons that I'm being sued by Telhio for $2,244.71. This amount is stated to be ""the final billing on your lease turn in based upon the final vehicle inspection."" I had intentions of purchasing the vehicle once my lease term was up. I had arranged an inspection appointment with CULA after the lease termination date of 12/29/18. Telhio decided to put in an order for my vehicle to be repossessed. On the Repossession Order it stated ""For non-payment since **3/13/19.** *I was late paying 3 months into the future?*

So I called Telhio the next day and asked how it was legal for them to repo my vehicle for payment delinquency for a date that hasn't even passed yet. The Telhio representative replied to my question (verbatim) ""What we do on our end when a lease comes to term, is we advance the due date out. That way it's not just sitting in our numbers as showing past due when you're supposed to be turning the unit in."" I do have a recording of him saying this. How is it legal for them to move their dates and numbers around so it ""looks better in their system""? I don't see how they can push a date out in their system but then say repossession was justified because I was past my termination date (even though I had an arrangement with CULA)

So I guess my biggest question is, should I reply to this summons saying that I am ""judgement proof"" or something along those lines? I have no disposable income. The income I do receive is exempt from garnishment. I have no valuable assets. They really cannot take anything from me as far as I can tell.. I was considering Ch 7 bankruptcy since the HAVEN act was passed and the VA disability is not counted in the means test anymore.. but if I can't be garnished what's the point in having that on my credit report for 10 years? It would be nice to have these 3rd Party debt collectors leave me alone though. Could I just ""negotiate"" to have them settle for $50 each? What would you do? I have to respond to this summons soon..

When I was finally awarded Social Security in 2019 I received a $16k lump sum in backpay and I did use 80% of that to pay off some of the credit card debts. I still have a lot looming over my head and I would just appreciate some helpful advice!

I agreed to pay 25 monthly. When I tried to make my first payment - I noticed the website only had an option to pay using a check. I emailed the lawyer I agreed on a payment plan with and she said they only accepted checks, I then email her letting her know that I do not have checks because I don't have. bank because I do not work and if there was an alternative way to pay. She never emailed me back. Last week I noticed they filed a FINAL JUDGMENT AND AFFIDAVIT OF NONPAYMENT. I then was able to get a hold on using a family members checkbook which I did not know I could do (use someone else's checks) I paid $25. I called the next day and spoke to someone (not the lawyer I've been speaking to from the start) and they said that since I didn't pay that I broke the agreement and if I want to be placed back on the agreement that I have to pay for the missing months. I then asked would the final judgement that was file be dropped, he said no but if I pay for the missing months I won't have to worry about going back to court. I then asked him, then what would happen to the final judgement that was filed - he replied back in ""I'm not going to waste my time and explain to you what that is, I'm sure you're smart enough to know"" I replied back that I have no knowledge in any of this. He said as long as I pay - I'm okay. Today I was able to get a hold of the first lawyer, She asked me if I wanted to be put back on the monthly agreement, I said yes and then asked for an update if anything else needed to be done, she said no as long as I make my monthly payments on time. She did not mention paying for the missing months like the previous person mentioned. I asked her if we're back on the $25 monthly repayment plan agreement and she replies ""its not the same as we initially agreed. we have submitted a judgment, you can begin paying $25 per month"" now she's not answering my emails.

What does this mean for me then? If I'm now back on the repayment plan and made a payment then what's the deal with the judgement they filed? What happens next.

I've been in talks with multiple contractors about doing work on a retaining wall. One contractor went to the property and saw the wall and called me with a quote on Thursday. I gave it a day and texted him back on Friday saying exactly the following "".Hey this is (my name) at (address), you came by yesterday and gave me a quote for $4600 on my retaining wall. I'm just letting you know I'm cool with going forward with that project""

After that text, he called me and we talked on the phone shortly after. At that time I stated I wanted to see a contract/details on the project so that I can sign it and give him a deposit which he asked for. I wanted to meet on either Sunday or Monday and we agreed. At this time, no time frame or dates were discussed for the actual work. We left the conversation that he would get back to me when he is free to meet in person.

Over the weekend, I had more contractors reach out to me with with better prices, so I decided to start conversations with those people in the mean time.

Sunday and Monday passes and I don't hear from him, I'm not that worried about it as I'm feeling more confident I can get the project done around $2k less anyways

Today I get a text from the contractor with photos of my retaining wall ripped up and material on the site to start putting it back together. I call and we had lengthy conversation that doesn't really matter for sake of this post.

Basically, does that single text hold me accountable to do work with this contractor? I never signed anything or even scheduled a start date. I didn't receive any paperwork and never handed him a deposit of any kind either.

What should I do? he thinks that single text is enough of a binding contract that would hold up in court. We only communicated on the phone otherwise.

Long story short. My Uncle(executor 1) has stolen my belongings from my childhood home which was his parents house. My other Uncle(executor 2) told me my cousin was told by executor 1 I sold him mine, my late father's and my late brother's valuables. I did not. We have not confronted him yet. I know my belongings were locked in the house when my grandmother passed 2+ years ago. I know the valuables are valued between $3000-$50k.

To help me with medical school applications this cycle, I've hired consultants to help me at an extremely steep price. During my complimentary consultation, I was told their program is split into sections which I will be proceeding through sequentially. Each section offers a different service and before I can move on to/start the next section, I must pay beforehand. This is also stipulated in the contract that I signed. Not sure if this is relevant but there is also a sentence that says ""Requests of payment made by the consultant to the client must be paid upon receipt."" Additionally, after completing a section, I have the right to not move on with the rest of the program. However, if I already decided to move on and then stop mid-section, I won't be getting my money back (understandable).

So the situation is this: I've already paid for two sections and I had no plans to continue with the next section because it's simply out of my budget. I was going to tell them this at the end of the second section. Today, I received a notification from them telling me the next payment was due. After I told them I was discontinuing the service, I was told that I already received service from the next section and therefore must pay. But I was never notified until now??? 

I'm super non-confrontational but I don't want to be pushed around and I don't want to deal with the stress of a court case on top of applications. I guess I just want to know: legally, am I in the wrong here or is the other party acting in bad faith? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do?

I'm worried if I make the wrong move, they'll slander me to the medical schools I'm applying to (they know everything about me as an applicant).

* Their bank has ""restricted"" the account and has notes posted all over their account, so apparently if the person were to go into a branch or make contact with the bank there would be alerts of some sort - but! the bank has no right to just withdraw the money, which I understand
   * I can't get a clear answer of what restricting the account means, we thought that it would mean they wouldn't be able to move the money out but apparently not?
   * Side note: I am confused about if the person is trying to pull the money out and get away with it, why they would open a second account at the same bank and not try to move it to another institution

My questions are:

* What might next steps be? Both our bank and theirs are kind of shrugging and saying there's nothing they can do. Would a lawyer be the next course of action?
   * What type of lawyer would I want to contact?
   * My partner wants to do some \~web\~ sleuthing/hire a PI and find this person's name and contact info but I think that would be kind of useless tbh if they're not responding to their own bank I don't see what we could do.
* What right does the receiving party have to the money? None right? I fully understand it was my mistake but also it does not seem like they can claim right to it.
   * What happens if they do respond to their bank and just say ""no I won't return the money""?

Not sure if relevant, but we were located in OR when we did the wire but have since moved to NYC.

It's been pretty frustrating dealing with the banks lol it's a pretty small amount of money relative to what they deal with often but it's pretty significant to my personal budget. Our bank is a small credit union and it feels like that has been a part of the problem for at least why it's taken us so long to get answers because they're very nice but seems like they have little sway in the banking world.

So long story short me and my fiancé are currently renting out a place. Although it wasn’t put into our lease agreement nor told to us when we signed the agreement. The owner would be swapping out the filter himself every three months. Now where the filter is changed is pretty easy to access so I went ahead and took a look to see if it was something I could easily do so that way the owner wouldn’t have to keep coming every three months to change it. Now I know that some owners like to do it themselves because it’s something that they’ve invested in. Anyways I opened it up it slipped right now and I put it back in and closed it. Now forward two months since then the owner comes to change it and says it’s out of place and takes it out and the filter is very dirty. Granted it’s been very hot lately so we’ve been operating the AC a lot more. So he goes on about me moving it and then says now he’s going to have some guys come take a look at it to see if we’ve caused any damage or build up or hopefully we don’t have to pay anything.

He also has property management to manage the place we are renting. I called him spoke to him about what was happening and he happened to mention that the owner said he hadn’t service the AC in 5 years and according to research I did online it’s recommended to do at least once a year. 

Fast forward technicians come for an assessment I overhear them talking about some dust build up on the fan and they also went to check the roof as well. They finish their visit owner leaves as well as the technicians and a few days later (today) I get a call from the owner calling me about the assessment setting up an appointment for cleaning the AC and tells me that he’s going to cover the $300 for cleaning but then proceeds to tell me that they need to clean or do something with the coils because there is gunk build up and that it will cost $600 and is trying to make us pay for it. Now my main question is how would the owner know or even the technicians know that all that build up was from the two months that the filter was out of place and not the fact that he hasn’t had the HVAC serviced in 5 years and is just trying to have us foot the bill?",legaladvice,HVAC System,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6zjyo/hvac_system/

Had a captain of a fishing boat in AK ask a family member if I'd come work for them for the salmon run in Bristol Bay.  Needed the money as am starving college student, so I accepted because they said I'd surely make between 250 - 500 dollars a day (they pay me a % of each day's income).  They paid for my flight up, and my commercial fishing license.  Now they told me I'd be working with the captain, his son, and the captain's brother.  

I get on the boat and they tell me the captain's brother is leaving in two days.  This was a 3 week job, and now I'd be on a smaller crew, so more work, but no pay increase. I worked for 5 days, and noticed what I was making so far was literally the same as I would making DoorDashing back home for 6-8 hour days and far better conditions.  I realized that there was no point in working 16-18 hour days, getting really shitty nutrition, and dealing with the psychopath that is a fishing captain for the same pay I was already making...  I built up the courage, and asked the captain if he felt he was paying me a fair wage, and the conversation went south quickly.  He told me he was going to debate firing me, and I figured it was going to be hell for the next two weeks if he didn't so I quit.  Now luckily for me I timed the conversation with our first day back on land since that day had been, otherwise I'd probably be at the bottom of the ocean rather than typing this post.

After I said I quit, he immediately told me he was splitting my pay in half, and docking the cost for the flights and commercial fishing license from the remainder.  This makes me wonder if he was trying to get me to quit when he told me he would debate firing me over any way shape or form of pay increase.  I told him this was bullshit because I had agreed to come up there on the assumption that the crew would be four including myself, and they had assured me multiple times that the pay would be good.  Now with fishing there was no guarantee that each day's catch would be fantastic, but for it to not even be any bit more than I was making as a delivery driver is different...

This fiasco was mid July.  I was told I would be paid (if at all) after the fishing season on the first week of August.  Yesterday I reached out to the captain basically saying pay me bitch, and he basically told me to eat shit, and that I owe him for the plane ticket and fishing license if anything.

Now I'm reaching out to this subreddit to ask if I have any case against the captain in terms of him dodging pay.  From my side I see him as being the employer, and paying for the plane tickets and commercial license as front end along the lines of training me as an employee.  I was also lied to as far as the crew size, and deceived as to what the pay would be.  I don't see quitting as any way for him to be able to say he doesn't owe me. I never signed any sort of w-2 forms to become an employee, but I did sign and provide ssn for the commercial fishing license, so maybe I would be an independent contractor? The only things I have as far as proof are the fish catches in pounds per day, and texts and photos from the captain saying what the pay would have been (and what he claims I would owe him). I know he isn't going to take any legal action, and I'm certain I wouldn't have to pay for the commercial license and the plane tickets if he tried, but I'm worried a court might act like I was just helping a friend since I didn't sign anything other than the commercial license form.  The only other thing I have is the photos of quick maffs he did to pwn me yesterday, and my own personally table I made on my phone while on the boat.

Do I have any sort of case or is this a meme?  If I wasn't in dire need of money at the moment, I probably would let it go. However a thousand dollars is a lot to me, and this cost me a week of work. On top of that I literally slept for most of three days when I got back from sleep deprivation and exhaustion, which are days I would've spent working if I hadn't heard of the fiasco.

We found the place together about a year ago, but life happens, and so for personal reasons I did not move in until 2 months ago. When I did so, we went up to the leasing office to add my name to the lease; they did the typical “fill out this info sheet so we can do a background check, we’ll take a photocopy of your license, sign these papers,” and then told me I was all set unless (jokingly) the check came back saying I was a murderer or something. I cannot for the life of me remember if I took a signed copy of anything (I’ve been looking just in case), and can’t find any emails or voicemails from the office. Yes, I have been kicking myself for not making absolute sure I had something to put in a place I’d remember.

Now, my roommate is moving out for college tomorrow, and when they went to the leasing office around 11am to ask a few questions about how to transfer things like the rent “payment portal” to me and my name, they were told that I am not even on the lease and that they have no record of me having lived here, or having done a background check or literally anything. The lease does not end until October 1st, but because she is moving out tomorrow and her name is apparently the only one on said lease, I am to also be moved out by 10am— unless of course I can come to the office at 4.30 tonight or 8.30 tomorrow morning (1.5 hrs before move out) to see if we can figure any part of this out? I was scheduled to work at 4 and had to call off so that I can go up there. I’ve called them 5x, left 2 voicemails asking if there’s any possible way to be met with sooner so that I know if I need to pack up literally everything I own and move out in the next 20hrs. (I’ve started doing that anyway since I’ve gotten no response.)

We were told a few other things by the office, but I don’t want this to be too lengthy or risk getting off-topic. Even if this shitshow somehow gets figured out there’s no way in hell I’d be renewing the lease.

I’m assuming there’s not much I can do unless I have some sort of signed paperwork or evidence as to my existence here, but if there is anything at all anybody can think of it would be much appreciated.

TLDR; Leasing office had me sign things that they have since lost. Therefore received 22hr notice to be moved out the next day despite lease not ending for over 40 more days.

I recently accepted an offer for a new job and this was supposed to be my first week.  Everything was going great from the recruiters to my new managers I interviewed with.  I was excited because some places require a bachelors degree and can't substitute experience.  They never mentioned education being a requirement. I started work this week and had no impression that anything was wrong.

Today my manager called me and said that my education background check failed and due to that plus me needing to take two classes this fall to finish my degree, I was terminated.

I never said to anyone that i have a bachelors degree, i never put it on my resume that i have a bachelors degree, and when they requested additional information regarding my education i told them my expected graduation was this december.  None of the half dozen people I talked to ever brought this up as a concern.  Even the HR rep I emailed detailing my education history, and my expected graduation this fall, didn't say it was a concern and proceeded with my employment and background check.

First: THANK YOU TO ALL FIRST RESPONDERS! I want to be clear, I am thankful for all that you do!

I owned a small business that unfortunately had a fire in July 2020. The property was a total loss and everything was destroyed. I had insurance on the property and have since sold the land to someone else in favor of not rebuilding the business.

Due to the business' location, several local volunteer fire departments came to the fire to assist in the extinguishing of the fire.

Fast forward to about a week ago and I received a letter in the mail from a person claiming to represent a local **volunteer** fire department who forwarded a 'bill' for FD services rendered. The bill is approximately $10K and appears to be someone acting as a ""debt collector"" (?). The bill is addressed to me personally and not the LLC that 'owned' my business and was sent to my personal address rather than being forwarded from my former business address. **The 'bill' is requesting payment made to a 3rd party LLC, NOT the represented FD.** Nowhere in the letter does it say if the requested funds will actually go to the represented FD or the % that will go to the FD (mind you the fire was more than a year ago at this point). This is the ONLY FD that I received a bill from and there were multiple volunteer FDs that came to the fire. 

This appears to me to be a scam as the ""debt collector"" that is requesting payment is 100% volunteer and the bill is not coming from the fire department. However, I want to do the right thing and look to pay if real, but not pay a scam. I have already made donations to my local volunteer fire company and local police that did assist where my business was located, but don't have the funds to actually pay all of the fire departments if they start to forward 'bills' for services rendered like this one. 

Is this legal? or a gray-area debt-collection shakedown where this person is looking for someone to pay a 'fake' bill where they pocket 99% and 1% will actually go to the FD?

TL;DR: Got a large bill in the mail from someone claiming to represent debt-collection services for a volunteer FD. Checking to see if this practice is legal and if I should pay.

His father and I have not been together since he was 3.  I am a nurse working 3 days a week and sometimes 2 if I'm working a weekend.  My ex's wife is a stay-at-home mom.  We have had joint custody without legal documents for years.  So its Sunday to Sunday.  For quite a few years when our son went to private school, I was taking my son to school on my days off during my week and also their week because she didn't want to have to get up to take him.  She would take him to school for me 1 or 2 days during my week and 1 or 2 days during their week (she had her dad take him). When she had a kid, she wanted my son to sleep there when they had to take him because she didn't want him to wake anyone up when he came inside the house then would complain and tell people nIever had my son although she threatened to not open the door in the morning if brought him over instead of letting him sleep there.  Meanwhile, they've treated me like absolute shit for years.    Now my son goes to a public school that has a bus he can take from my house.  His dad lives in a different district so he cant get a bus there so she would have to take him.  I live right near the school.  She is now telling me she doesn't want to take him because her son only has to be at school at 9 and she doesn't want to have to drive so far out of her way to take my son during their week because its not her son. (They are married). I told her that he could stay at my house during their week when I'm off so he can get the bus.

My question is 

If I would take this to a lawyer what would happen?  I understand it is my son but why is it my responsibility during their week to get him to school?

On top of those already existing and still existing issues we know had, leaking sink, fly/gnat problem, broken garbage disposal, for our other outside door(not the sliding one) our key doesn't work for, and rusty razor blades and nails littered across the patio. We brought this to our landlords attention the same day and filed the report saying everything wrong with it to the management group. We were told ""We have to get everyone together and discuss how to tackle this and get a list of all the items listed to replace/fix"". This was July 1st.

I was not fired but my position was changed without my approval to a float position. I then had no guaranteed hours  aka 0 hours. if I was able to pick up a shift if would be 30+ miles away from the location I was originally hired at and maybe once a week IF a shift was available.

If I had been on regular unemployment I would have had to use savings and defintinlty could not make rent on just regular unemployment.

Recently I filed and was approved for my LLC in NY. I know my next steps are to do the publications for 6 weeks and provide that proof within 120 days... but I have a few other questions as well.

I am a travel agent (yes we still exist, and we're growing very well!) and have an independent contractor status with an agency. They provide me an agency phone number and agency email account. Our email signatures and our business cards are all (for the most part, unless the agent decides to use their LLC name) in the agency's name.

All that being said however, do I have to write my LLC anywhere? (maybe on my email signature?) Clients see us as working in regards with this specific agency. But, all independent contractors here (as well as the industry really) have LLC's to protect their independent business/portfolio. The LLC aspect is more for legal protections and is required by most agencies.

I want it to be valid though, so what should I do? Add it to the bottom of my email signature? Put it on my business card? I don't know of many other agents doing this UNLESS they elect to maintain using their LLC name and just run their tickets through the agency's resources - rather than what most agents do, which is keep the agency's email signature.

Legally speaking, we are not affiliated with, partnered with, nor employees of the agency. They provide us with all the resources we need to take our existing portfolios and book clients. The house will also sometimes refer certain clients to independent agents. The house negotiates the commission rates from vendors/airlines/hotels, etc. And they take a cut of our earnings to compensate for that heavy lifting.

&amp;#x200B;

Our home is located outside of city limits, in a more rural area of town. We have 5 acres with a small barn and three paddocks for our horses. We have neighbors on all sides, but don't interact with them much as they also have 5-30 acres each and we are somewhat removed from each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our neighbor on the back side of the property has been clearing out the trees from their land and doing some construction. The problem we have been having is that instead of disposing of their tree/brush waste, they are creating huge piles of trees and brush all along the property line. 

&amp;#x200B;

These piles are on their property and are not spilling into our property. Besides being generally ugly, we are concerned about these piles becoming the perfect home to snakes and other creatures. The sticks/trees/brush piles are along the fence right next to where our horses graze.

&amp;#x200B;

We do plan on speaking with them and asking them to dispose of the waste in another manner, and we aren't necessarily looking for any kind of legal action. I am more on a fact finding mission to see what, if any, legal recourse we might have. 

Is it legal to make piles like this along the property line? Are there any resources I can seek out for advice? As mentioned above, it is not spilling onto our property, but we have concerns about what this could bring as far as wildlife is concerned. We have horses and other animals on our small farm, and have deadly snakes in this part of the state.

About two months ago I moved from Colorado to Georgia. I called a moving company (actually a broker, located in Florida, who contracted the moving company, headquartered in Colorado), they did an estimate over the phone, and I scheduled a date for pickup. When the movers came, they made it clear that the estimate wasn't correct and that the bill would be double(!) the estimate. I didn't have much choice due to a time crunch, so I had them pack it all up and I agreed to pay the total amount - half now, half later. Seemed fine (I mean, it wasn't - the cost was obscene, but there was no time to quibble).

A month later they came and dropped *almost* everything off. Many things were broken, many boxes squished like you wouldn't believe, but more importantly there were boxes missing. I advised the movers of this, noted it on the paperwork along with the broken items, and they told me they'd go looking for these items in the local warehouse. They advised me over the next few days that they'd found 3 of our missing 5 boxes, that some folks were coming to drop them off in a few days, and then... nothing.

I have contacted our mover directly, I have called their customer support, I have emailed them, and the response back has always been ""we'll look into it"" but then I do not receive word back (beyond 'Contacted dispatch, will let you know'). It's looking more and more like they're running out the clock needed to file claims, and it is quite frustrating to have some confirmation that they're holding on to my boxes but just not doing anything with them.

Anyway, we're approaching the 90 day deadline to file claims. I would be happy (well, not really) to do so, but I fear they'll use the claims as a catalyst to stop looking for boxes and just write off the claimed amount. I would much prefer having my stuff, as many of those things are irreplaceable (why is it always stuff that you care about that goes missing?).

So I turn to you, /r/legaladvice. This is a new process for me - most things in life I've been able to sort out without resorting to the legal system, but these folks are drag-assing and I honestly don't know what to do. I feel quite powerless, and I'm looking to rectify that issue. Any advice you can give would be much appreciated, thank you all!",legaladvice,"Recently moved but the movers are still holding some of our boxes, what to do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6yhdd/recently_moved_but_the_movers_are_still_holding/

The apartment was great in terms of utilities included, perks, natural light, etc, but the apartment itself was disgusting. It had stains all over the blinds, holes in the floor, stains on the ceiling, and missing a handle/lock on a sliding door. We were told if we decided to move in it would all be fixed. It comes July 1st after we'd signed the lease and decided to move in hoping they'd stick to their word. It turns out they hadn't and things were worse. On top of those already existing and still existing issues we know had, leaking sink, fly/gnat problem, broken garbage disposal, for our other outside door(not the sliding one) our key doesn't work for, and rusty razor blades and nails littered across the patio. We brought this to our landlords attention the same day and filed the report saying everything wrong with it to the management group. We were told ""We have to get everyone together and discuss how to tackle this and get a list of all the items listed to replace/fix"". This was July 1st. About a month later (August 1st) nothing had been done and I decided to go and talk to them again, this time they said they'll call within a week and let us know when someone is coming. I hear absolutely nothing from them, no phone call, no text, no visit. I went in again on the 13th of August and they said they'd call tomorrow and send someone over. Its the 18th and still no response or any action taken.

8. MAINTENANCE BY LANDLORD: Landlord shall:
(a) Comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety. 
(b) Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the dwelling unit in a fit and habitable condition.
(c) Keep all common areas of the premises in a clean and safe condition.
(d) Maintain in good and safe working order utilities.

None of those conditions have been met and we're considering getting the law involved in this for health and safety violations along with going against the lease. Would anything get done if this was taken to court or is it a lost cause until our lease is up?

The franchisee responded with ""corporate is following all the latest federal, state, and CDC guidelines, and as an owner of this location I am not going to require us to ask for proof of vaccination- in fact I don't want anybody asking anybody about their vaccination status.""

I mean *really*??!! So you're going to endanger your employees AND your customers just because you don't want somebody to complain? I've done so much research into the legal ramifications of this type of thing and there is literally no way that the company could be sued over asking our customers if they're vaccinated OR just requiring them be.

on the 26th of july i slept in during my 8-10am internet install appointment. the xfinity guy had called me several times so i just called him back. he told me that he was still in my apartment building working on someone else, but since it was part the timeframe if he were to work on my issue i would need to “make it worth his while”. at first i was ready to dismiss this as a misunderstanding because he seemingly “corrected himself” by clarifying that $40 would make it worth his while cause he had kids to feed. i told him that i didn’t understand why i have to pay him extra if i already paid $100 for him to come and if the issue is him not getting paid then i can just call xfinity myself and say it’s a glitch or a mistake. he said that he was actually int he unit right under me so he was just going to come up so that we could talk in person. 

once he got to my apartment, he repeated the same phrase (and another one that i can’t remember rn but i’ll ask my boyfriend cause he does but trust and believe it had a very similar connotation) but this time, i remember that he happened to say something along the lines of “yea you gotta make it worth my while some kind of way, you think imma do this for free? make it worth my while *or* pay $40” and at this moment my boyfriend walked out of my room and just stood in the doorway. it was clear that he didn’t know someone else was here. he started trying to recover and say that the $40 would be the thing worth his while but when he left my bf said he heard the whole thing and he was “very much giving cash ass or grass energy”

NOW ONTO THE ISSUE:

i called xfinity cause of course i had to reschedule and i didn’t want him to be the one that came back. the first time i called a rep said that since he’s a contractor, she has no idea what he is and is not allowed to say. 

i called back the next day and the woman i talked to said that she was never trained on a situation like this so she isn’t sure the exact procedure but she’ll do everything in her power to get this where it needs to go.

an hour later her boss calls, and then his boss and they all apologize profusely. they tell me that there is no way that he will work with them again. i’m like okay cool

nothing really happens until last week when i get two calls from the corporate office of the contracting company that the guy works for. the first call was asking me if i was sure he offered me an opportunity to bribe him. i was like yes, and the conversation was over 

the next time was an exec and here were the major talking points:
- the man claims that i offered him money. (i didn’t obviously)
- have i filed a police report? (no, i didn’t even know i could)
- he’s been “off post” since the 5th (it was the 10th). he has missed 5 days of work. what else am i “seeking”?

and it’s just, the way he was talking to me was just weird and i’m starting to get worried about the legal possibilities. was he trying to get me to promise not to sue? can i sue? why hadn’t that man been fired? should i file a police report? i waited so long to post this cause i asked my moma friend who’s a lawyer, and i found out that she didn’t reply cause her husband is sick. but either way i told this man that i would call him back and tell him what i came up with so i’m very conflicted

Also on mobile, so formatting is crap, and I'm sorry for the long post, but we really, REALLY need the help.

BACKGROUND:
So, I started a war (what it feels like) with my electric co-op at the beginning of the year. Problems range from horrible customer service to blatant, unrepentant theft (such as putting customers who never got behind on their bills during covid last year on a repayment plan, and not informing other customers that they may have been overcharged). It started 10 years ago when the new GM (with no actual qualifications to run a co-op; was hired instead of an engineer with years of experience) somehow got hired for a job he didn't know how to do (can you say $60 million in debt added over those 10 years). I can expound more if needed. I've spoken to them in person, in email, and over the phone (all recorded) while they lied straight to me. This has been going on since January, and not once has any Board member addressed any customer concerns. I've done my research, and there is NO governmental oversight (although they claim that the State Co-op is supposed to provide oversight, it's really just a vicious cycle of State and National {they provide the tech that allows us to be robbed} co-ops covering each others' ass). I went so far as to contact the congressman who addressed the House in 2008, about co-ops, their lack of oversight, and the very real possibility it would be taken advantage of (spoiler alert: they're taking advantage), with very little results. I contacted the local news, and while the reporter genuinely wanted to help, the co-op gave her so much run around she couldn't really help either. I've also discovered we are not alone. I've found almost 15 other groups across the country (on FB, power co-op failures groups) that have similar, and some of the exact same problems (all of our CEOs/managers/etc go to conferences together at the state and national co-op level, giving them the opportunity to compare strategies on how to really stick it to the consumer). In the future, if I can ever actually find a lawyer with some insight, we (I and the leaders of the other groups) will take on the national co-op (provider of tech).

NOW PROBLEM:
The plan was originally (I have 2000 members or about 7% in my group, not counting the members with me who don't social media) to replace the Board through the annual vote (3-4 districts voted on per year over 3 years). However, they are now denying members who put in the work (filling out paperwork with the co-op, getting at least 50 signatures from your district to be nominated) their nominations so that they can run unopposed and keep control. This means we will have to take the board by force, which can be done. I've read a couple of articles about co-ops who successfully ousted and replaced their entire board in one go. This will require a petition to remove the whole Board (possibly separate petitions for separate members?), and I have all the questions, such as-
*Do they have to do something blatantly illegal to be removed?
*Can they be removed by a vote of no confidence, alone?
* Do we need separate petitions for each board member or can we have one that covers them all?
*What things do I need to include (I have signed petitions but never organized one) to make sure it's valid and legal (I will be collecting thousands of signatures, mostly by myself, so I need to make sure it's not a wasted effort)?
*Anything petition-wise that I may have left out (any and all info is appreciated)

I have attempted to find any lawyer (in my state) that could help us fight them. I called on the NC Bar Foundation's statewide service Day (free legal advice for anyone) but they only directed me to a civil attorney with no clue.

Starting with the backstory:

I am 15 years old. I met this kid while I was walking to my cousin's house for a party. He heard from others that he's 12 but looking at him, he could be 9 or 10. I was walking with my sister and he jokingly asked if my sister was my gf. I said no and that she's my sister but he kept saying that is your gf. I walked away and ignored and that was my first interaction with him. The second time I met him, I was walking with my friend around our city and he saw us. He looked at me and my friend and called us Dummy #1 and Dummy #2. The third time I met him (and when the incident happened), I was sitting on my cousin's porch with my sister and other cousins. I was waiting for one of my cousin to get ready so she can go walking with me, my sister, and my other cousins. He approached us in front of my cousin's house and he was riding his bike. He stopped by us and called all of us Dummy #1, Dummy #2, etc. Before I came, he had threatened to throw rocks at the cousins. I repeatedly told him to stop and not to call me dumb. He then called me fat, the b word, and the f word. I kept telling him to stop (maybe at least 10 times). He even said he was going to throw a rock at me. He went to continue to ride and I chased him to my other cousin's house (which was two houses away). He looked at me and told me what I'm going to do. Now, here is where it is my fault. I picked his bike up (not fully but 1 inch from the ground) and pushed him. Before he could fully fall on the ground, I held on to his bike and pushed him on the grass. He was still on his bike when he landed on the grass.  I knew I shouldn't have used violence and I regret that. It would have been better if I just yelled at him. I felt humiliated that he embarrassed me in front of others and that he called me dumb and fat and said other cuss words. I've had many self esteem issues about the weight even though I'm not fat.

Starting with the backstory:

I am 15 years old. I met this kid while I was walking to my cousin's house for a party. He heard from others that he's 12 but looking at him, he could be 9 or 10. I was walking with my sister and he jokingly asked if my sister was my gf. I said no and that she's my sister but he kept saying that is your gf. I walked away and ignored and that was my first interaction with him. The second time I met him, I was walking with my friend around our city and he saw us. He looked at me and my friend and called us Dummy #1 and Dummy #2. The third time I met him (and when the incident happened), I was sitting on my cousin's porch with my sister and other cousins. I was waiting for one of my cousin to get ready so she can go walking with me, my sister, and my other cousins. He approached us in front of my cousin's house and he was riding his bike. He stopped by us and called all of us Dummy #1, Dummy #2, etc. Before I came, he had threatened to throw rocks at the cousins. I repeatedly told him to stop and not to call me dumb. He then called me fat, the b word, and the f word. I kept telling him to stop (maybe at least 10 times). He even said he was going to throw a rock at me. He went to continue to ride and I chased him to my other cousin's house (which was two houses away). He looked at me and told me what I'm going to do. Now, here is where it is my fault. I picked his bike up (not fully but 1 inch from the ground) and pushed him. Before he could fully fall on the ground, I held on to his bike and pushed him on the grass. He was still on his bike when he landed on the grass.  I knew I shouldn't have used violence and I regret that. It would have been better if I just yelled at him. I felt humiliated that he embarrassed me in front of others and that he called me dumb and fat and said other cuss words. I've had many self esteem issues about the weight even though I'm not fat. He then, of course, started crying. My aunt came out to see him. She was asking if he's okay, and needs any ice, and what happened. She noticed that there were scratches on his arm and leg. He then rode back to his house. 

My aunt called my mom to explain what happened. She was pissed of me and I fully take the blame of hitting him. I knew I should not have done that.

I helped move everything in and set autopayments to a checking account that got social security income that exceeded the cost of the unit monthly.

Everything went fine for the first few years as I helped to eliminate items from the unit when I could (I am in the Military and only get to visit home so often). My Dad has dementia and my Mom is too busy taking care of him to really get to work on it.

They recently had a letter in the mail with a 'lien of sale' notification for a motorcycle that was stored in that unit that came from a towing site in downtown. This was puzzling because the vehicle was locked up in the unit. Sure enough, I called the storage center and they said they auctioned off all my family's stuff in 20 July :(

They had an address on file that was the foreclosed house address from 2019 and a wrong email that they said they were sending warnings to that I knew we had changed (we've been contacted before). They claimed to have contacted the phone on file but we have no record of texts or messages.   
The social security checking account has a large balance now because payments weren't going through for months (I didn't think to monitor the account because there was no trigger for suspicion).

I'm at a loss of what to do, and my small family is devastated because there were things in there from my family dating to the early 1800s that are irreplaceable.

But the problem is that he doesn't give any notice, and basically says he's going to take FMLA leave minutes before he leaves, and our company isn't doing anything about it. From my understanding, FMLA leave (medical in this case) should be for doctors appointments and such, but my coworker complains he doesn't feel well and takes FMLA leave and leaves us short-handed when we are already short-staffed without notice. I don't know what his medical reason was for getting FMLA approved, but he has used his PTO before for getting surgery on a wart on his foot. And when we talk to HR about it, all they say is that they have to approve his leave whenever he takes it, without any notice or evidence and that he will get his full salary because he is salaried-exempt.

Now I mention that last point because, 2 years ago (before my company offered FMLA) I was out 3 months due to a surgery, and they didn't pay me even though I am salaried-exempt as well.

I would like some advice if my complaints are valid and I can sue the landlord/building management company.

We have moved into a new apartment building in march 2020. The first months were ok-ish, even with COVID, as the building was almost empty. Around summer though, the began making huge offers, like 4 months rent free, and so hoarded a lot of uncivilized individuals into the building.

The issues which we were facing since the beginning:

\- In April 2020, the the height of the 1st wave of COVID, the building management didn't bother to install hand sanitizer disposers anywhere. I have requested that, because another property, managed by the same company, had them. They actually did install those devices, after some time. But after the first load of sanitizer was empty, for 2 months they didn't refill them.

\- Amenity spaces were closed during that time - in accordance to the state mandates. Our amenity fee though was not refunded, even though Bozzuto (the building mgmt. company) received financial government aid.

\- Residents were ""friendly reminded"" to wear masks. Obviously, some covidiots didn't, but they were not bothered by the building management. Back then, it was a state mandate in VA.

\- The building is huge and only has 3 elevators, so social distancing was impossible

\- People were and still are smoking marijuana in the building. This was the case also when it was illegal. I have filed a police report as well about it. I have complained multiple times about this, but all the management did was send ""friendly reminders"" to please don't smoke. No evictions, and I have specifically sent a picture of some perpetrators in the act.

\- When some amenity spaces were reopened with limited capacity and mask mandate, the same residents didn't bother wearing one. Again, building mgmt. didn't do anything. I have complained yet again, and they put extra reminders at elevators to please wear masks, but with no consequences if not.

\- One resident, which I asked nicely on the floor to wear a mask because of my son, insulted me repeatedly (East-DC education I guess...). Building manager acknowledged that they had other complaints about that individual, but didn't evict them for another month.

\- ...

\- fast forward to yesterday, the garage was reeking (yet again, happens every second day) of marijuana smell, and my toddler began coughing from the smell. I will take him to the doctor.

\- even with the Delta variant, they haven't reinstated the mask mandates, even in the elevators.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand my frustration, I have a small toddler which I need to keep safe, because he cannot get vaccinated against COVID.

As a conclusion, I strongly believe the building management is incompetent and doesn't enforce rules to keep our family safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my questions:

1. Do I have a ground, considering the repeated complaints, to sue Bozzuto for not ensuring a healthy environment and request the rent be reimbursed?

2. Can I charge them for the medical bill to check out my son?

3. Can I request the reimbursement of the amenity fee, considering we couldn't use the facilities?

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the lease agreement, and one paragraph states that ""Possession, use ... of marijuana will result in immediate termination"". Clearly they didn't enforce that. Is this a breach of the agreement?

A guy backed up into my car while parked with his work truck. Freaked out because he was afraid of getting fired. Accepted fault and agreed to pay for damages.

However, they changed their tone the moment the price for rental came. They had a budget and didn’t want to go over. I filed an over the counter police report and asked the guy to meet me at the station so he could say his side of story. Refused. I asked for his info, he refused. Cop said it was consider a hit and run. Suggested me to contact company to get insurance info. I did and they refused. Finally filed a claim with my insurance. The boss of the company has been trying to scare me off by stating they have additional witnesses and that I’m screwed (there were only 2 and I put them down on the report since they gave me their information). Boss also said he was seeking legal advice because he came across a post of mine seeking advice about the insurance and said I was slandering him and the company (which I never named).

I have been struggling very bad at work for many months and barely scraping by meeting my goals. I have had several conversations with my direct supervisor re: the issues with my work performance over these months and what we could specifically do to get me back on track. My mental health declined so much that a few weeks before my diagnosis we had additional conversations about what was going on with me where I disclosed to her that I was going to get tested for ADHD. I also emailed my work group prior to getting tested to let them know I suspected ADHD and I emailed again confirming my diagnosis last week. Since starting treatment, it is a night and day difference. I expected to get back to work and get caught up on everything and was clear about my intention with my team. 

However, last Thursday my direct supervisor and her boss had a private meeting with me, in which, they told me I can no longer discuss having ADHD and I cannot “use it as an excuse for poor work performance because it opens them up to litigation if they fire me.” He then said they were going to fire me last week, but decided to wait until I had my appointment. Now instead, he put me on a 60 day probation period. 

In the days since, I have noticed that my supervisors are not providing me with work and I suspect they are passing along tasks that used to be my responsibility to my coworker. This is a big problem because I bill my time and without meeting my daily goals it is guaranteed they will fire me after 60 days. Not making your hours IS grounds for termination. And for the record, I was making my hours for the most part, excepting having a mental breakdown recently and considering I am new to this position and had to be trained. I am mostly behind on the year for that reason (+now realizing I have been struggling with ADHD explains why that has been as hard as it was). 

I suspect they will claim they’re firing me for downsizing reasons related to Covid “because there isn’t enough work for me now.” However, there are multiple other work groups who have and are providing me with work. Our business is incredibly high volume. I think it’s wrong for them to fire me when they could at the very least pass me along to another work group. And this is to say nothing of how they act around me now. It’s like I don’t even exist. This feels pretty personal. 

Is this discriminatory? Is there anything I can do?

I think discrimination or pettiness would require a lot of evidence. Plus, I know ""at-will"" employment doesn't really protect workers much. But if anyone has any valuable input, I'd really appreciate it.

If you want more context....

- My aunts and mom (who are Hispanic and US citizens) were told March of 2020 by their housekeeping manager (I'll call her Manager A) that they would be laid off and then once things got back to normal they'd be getting a call back to work. Manager A was told this by the owners of the hotel. This was all verbal, so technically no documents or paper for ""proof"". This manager eventually quit a few months later but is still in touch with my mom and aunts since they personally know each other. The hotel ownership also changed hands during the pandemic.

- A few months ago, the new housekeeping manager (Manager B) called back everyone who was still on unemployment but not my aunts or my mother. Prior to this, most who were working during the pandemic were undocumented.

- Sometime after this, my mother (with me being her translator of sorts) called the general manager of the hotel and asked if she could get her position back. The GM essentially said the position was unavailable but she could be a room assistant and clean rooms. My mom agreed to this and was told by the GM she would be getting a call back from Manager B to properly reschedule her back to work. She never got a call back.

- Fortunately, my mom and aunts have been receiving unemployment throughout the pandemic including recently but they still would like their old positions back. They're not even sure if everything that has transpired is legal or not. They're somewhat speculating they've been replaced due to their ages (my aunts are 60+ and my mom will turn 60 next year). They also suspect simple pettiness since Manager B didn't really like my aunts or mom while they were working there.",legaladvice,[Illinois] My aunts and mom suspect they haven't been called back to work due to age discrimination or even just pettiness.

Trying to keep this as to the point as possible:  
Special ordered a Vehicle several months back for a 2021 Model. The salesperson we were buying from told us multiple times that ordering a car from the manufacturer means they have to sell it at MSRP. We have a signed order form with the stated price (print underneath says actual price set by the dealer.) and a Deposit to start the order.  


Due to COVID and other shipping complications, rarity of the car etc. The order was delayed for so long that it ended up getting switched over to a 2022. The price increase for MSRP was around 300$.  


The car finally arrived, our salesperson again states that its at MSRP and its nice to get a newer model with such a minor price increase (referring to the small increase of 300$).  


We go through all the paperwork, etc etc. Take the Car home no problems. I'm getting ready to file my paperwork and notice that the actual sale price had been increased by 4500$ over MSRP. Yes we singed all the papers and contracts etc, I made the stupid mistake of not checking everything over very carefully, I stupidly assumed we could expect them to be honest.  


In my State The Auto-Buyer's bill of Rights states "" You have a right to receive truthful statements from a dealer throughout your transaction."" and "" You have a right to truthful advertising from a dealership and a right to expect a dealer to honor the terms set forth in its advertisements and promotions."" There are obviously more but these are the ones I believe to be relevant.   


I called the dealer and told them about the difference in price compared to what we were told. After a few days of phone tag a ""Sales Director"" got with me and basically tried to scare me into #1 giving him the car back and voiding the contract or #2 sucking it up and dealing with the price we got because in his words he could get ""40,000$ over MSRP for this car right now."" (Like I said this is actually a very rare and sought after car right now.)  


I called our original  Salesperson and verified with him again that when we ordered a car from the manufacturer they were only allowed to charges MSRP. Again he said yes and that it didn't make sense why we were charged over by so much.

I live in Alabama and I was recently notified that I might be subpoenaed in a family members custody battle (also in Alabama).

I have been very paranoid that I might have accidentally thrown away the subpoena with the junk mail, even though I don't believe I have. 

Question 1:
Would a subpoena being sent by mail require a signature? Or can it be dropped in the mailbox without notifying the household? If it requires a signature, I know I haven't signed for anything.

Question 2:
Additionally, when a subpoena is being sent to a third party for a custody battle - do both main parties involved in the case know? For example, if the case is between x and y, and y subpoenas z - is x also notified? I really, really just want to make sure I don't miss anything and get in trouble. I am blood related to one of the parties in the case, and I may be getting subpoenaed by the opposing party (which is very weird to me, but I don't understand legalese much...).

I live in Alabama and I was recently notified that I might be subpoenaed in a family members custody battle (also in Alabama). I tried doing some research but I'm still a little unclear, I believe that a subpoena can only be delivered either be person or certified mail in Alabama.

I have been very paranoid that I might have accidentally thrown away the subpoena with the junk mail, even though I don't believe I have. 

Question 1:
Would a subpoena being sent by mail require a signature? Or can it be dropped in the mailbox without notifying the household? If it requires a signature, I know I haven't signed for anything.

Question 2:
Additionally, when a subpoena is being sent to a third party for a custody battle - do both main parties involved in the case know? For example, if the case is between x and y, and y subpoenas z - is x also notified? I really, really just want to make sure I don't miss anything and get in trouble. I am blood related to one of the parties in the case, and I may be getting subpoenaed by the opposing party (which is very weird to me, but I don't understand legalese much...).

Question 3:
And if you do miss a subpoena and aren't sure if you are being requested to come to a case, is there someone to contact to check on your behalf?

The sober sex was fully consensual and fun. 

But then we got high on two bowls of marijuana. I had never really been high before. He kept making me take hits even as I was losing touch with reality and I got scared I couldn't feel my body anymore. He kept laying on top of me, begging me to let him \*\*\*\* me, and I kept saying, ""I can't, I can't."" He said I didn't have to move, but I kept saying ""I can't."" I started giving him oral and sometimes he would guide me there and I hoped this would satisfy him and stop the PIV sex requests. But then, out of nowhere, without my consent or understanding of what he was about to do, he used his hand to slam the back of my head on his dick in an attempt to have me deepthroat him. He did this multiple times. I was terrified. He went to the bathroom and I ran to my room to calm myself and get away. He came into my room and kept saying, ""Do you want to deepthroat me? I thought you wanted to suck me. I thought you wanted to suck me."" I finally moved towards his penis because he kept shaming me. Then he smacked the back of my head again without me knowing he was going to do that. It was painful. He had an angry look on his face and his phone was in his hand aimed towards us. It looked like he was recording but my vision was so blurry....

I texted three friends for help. One of them called me and I put her on speaker, she begged him to leave, he refused. I demanded to see his phone, he complied after he did something on it first. I couldn't find anything but later he texted me, ""I know you saw my Reddit history, I know it's messed up, I can explain."" I did not see it and he never explained.

My friend and her boyfriend came and scared him off.

The next day, he called me to apologize and said, ""I thought you wanted me to smack your head on me"" and, ""I wasn't actually gonna...."" (trails off as he is too cowardly to say the word that rhymes with tape). 

He told me it was all in my head and I believed him. For a long time, I pushed it out of my mind.

There were other incidents. 

There was an incident where I found out he'd slept with someone right before we met up again last fall, so when we met up, I said we needed a condom. He fake laughed, said, ""What are you talking about?"" in a fake happy voice, then pulled me by my cheek and slapped me over and over again (not in a sexual way) and said, ""I can do whatever I want, got it?"" Again, sex had not started so this was not sexual, this was him truly being angry that I had asked for a condom. That's not being a dumbass, that's being manipulative and controlling.  

One time he jammed himself into me when I was still dry, without warning or anything, and I started sobbing in pain, and he closed his eyes to ignore me and kept going while on top of me. 

One time when I was drunk (he claimed he was but he didn't seem to be), he smacked my face (after I'd already told him both verbally and via text I don't want to be hit) so hard, I saw stars, then he told me, ""I love you"" and then, ""Hey, look at me, I love you"" while literally INSIDE me with oxytocin flying all over the place, and then stared at me until I said it back. Then he said, ""You're gonna come fuck me now by my house whenever I want, right?""   

I still deal with PTSD flashbacks if I ever get too high again, and I remember how he abused me that first day, the day I tried to forget happened to me. 

We continued hooking up off and on from September 2020 to June 2021. The guilt is eating away at me that I never reported him, that I let this happen to me, and that because I never reported him, there were probably other victims.

I have some questions:

1.) Can I report him now, or is it too late?

2.) Can I report him just to put this on his record and avoid going to court? I don't want to deal with pressing charges, I just want this on his record.

3.) Can I report everything if I don't remember specific dates for each assault besides the first one on Sunday, September 13, 2020?

4.) Where do I report him, if I now live in NY, and the incident happened in CT (where he still lives)?

5.) He doesn't know my current NY address and I don't want him to, but would he be able to find out on the police report?

6.) Will he be notified immediately of the police report or will it just sit on his file without his knowledge until something else happens?

Thank you for your help.

The first judge sided with me and awarded me the full amount of my security deposit, plus damages.

The damages in question are blinds that were broken from normal usage. They all broke one-by-one as the months went on. These blinds have an expected service life of 3 years.

What do we do???

Just over a year ago, our neighbor's dog broke its leash and tried to attack our 11 month old while she and my husband were out for a walk (they were letting me sleep in). My husband was bit when he physically put himself between her and the dog, but he wasn't the intended target. The dog is over 100 pounds, and the bite would've been much worse if it had been going after him. He just got in the way. It kept lunging, growling and barking, and trying to get around him as he kept spinning to keep the baby out of its grasp and trying to push the dog away, and the attack only stopped when the owners came outside to retrieve the animal.

We called the police to report the attack, and the cop literally said ""well sometimes dogs get protective of what they think is their territory, what do you want me to do?"" We told him the public street should be safe for anyone walking on it and we wanted him to talk to the owners and make sure they did something. We then sent them a letter telling them we're sorry we felt the need to call the police but since it broke the skin we felt it needed to be on record. We asked them to please do something to address the dog's aggression or at least tell us when it's going to be outside so we can work around it.

I'll give you one guess as to how well that went.

They replaced the leash with a longer one and moved the tie point to the porch instead of the middle of the yard. Now, it's impossible to tell whether the dog is out at all until it rushes you - but don't worry, it'll rush you. Every single time it sees us or anyone visiting, it will rush at us growling and barking. It chased a delivery driver back into her car and kept barking so aggressively that she called me and said she wasn't going to be able to deliver our food until the owners took the dog inside. The owners have been outside with the dog for several of these attempted attacks, so they know what's going on.

We reached out to them again after a year and told them enough is enough and something needs to be done. Not just a fence, because no fence will stop a dog this determined to attack, but an actual run/cage that will keep everyone safe. Considering the very restrictive ordinances on dangerous dogs in our city, this is honestly the kindest path.

What they did *instead* was request a six foot privacy fence from the zoning board, and here's where I need help, because they lied their ass off about us in their application for a higher than normal fence. In their letter they claim that the dog is for emotional support, say that we told them we ""don't like big dogs"" and say that since we haven't offered to put a fence on our property, well that responsibility falls on them (making themselves both saints and martyrs at the same time). It's a load of bull, and I'm furious. They're painting us as the bad guys making them put up a 6 ft privacy fence for the sake of ""neighborhood harmony"" with no mention of the fact that this dog has waged a terror campaign against my family for over a year. Now it's on the official record that we told them we don't like living next to a big dog and there's nothing we can do to correct that record. Once they get their request approved, they'll put up the fence, leave the dog out all day (just as they did before the first attack) and the dog will have free access to dig under or figure a way over the fence. And since it's a privacy fence, we won't know where the dog is until it charges.

Is there anyone here who knows what we should do?

We have videos of the dog being aggressive, copies of the letters we sent to the owners, and I'm going to try to get a copy of the police report filed after the initial attack/bite. Should we go to the board meeting (it's via zoom) and object to the fence just to get our side on the public record? Call the police again? Moving is not an option right now since we sunk all our savings into a new roof and solar panels.

I'm a government employee, and I have been forced to go into the office even though I asked for an exemption and was denied. I have an infant and feel uncomfortable being in close confines with others who are unmasked and unvaccinated. 

My employer has a nursing suite which behind a locked door. The room has three curtained areas for multiple women to nurse at once. Today, I was using the room with the curtains closed in my area. The other two areas had open curtains, indicating those areas were vacant, and this arrangement is spelled out on the signs in the area. 

I was using the nursing suite to pump breast milk today when a woman entered the suite and invited a man to enter with her. They walked around, talking about the space, and with no warning whatsoever, the woman yanked the curtains to my area open. I said, ""Excuse me, someone is in here!"" Then she closed the curtains, and said she didn't know anyone was there. I responded, ""That's why the curtains are closed."" She muttered ""bitch"" and she and the man left. I feel like I should mention that my pump was running and is fairly loud.

I attempted to find out who it was, and the building manager said he knew who it was but refused to give me that information. I reported the incident to my HR contact, and while she was sympathetic, I'm not sure anything will come of it.

So, I'd like to know what my rights are. Is my employer following the law in providing a shared space for expressing breast milk? The room requires a key card to access, but other than the curtains, there is no privacy from others in the room. People who are not expressing breast milk have access to the room. The first time I used the nursing suite, the building manager used his key card to give me access. 

The nursing suite is nice. It has a sink so I can wash my pump parts in privacy. It has a small fridge for storing breast milk that others use. I feel like my employer has tried to provide a comfortable space for expressing breast milk. I just feel like this shouldn't happen. I shouldn't be walked in on, and certainly not by a sight seeing pair of employees. 

I've had anxiety using the nursing suite since then, and my milk volume has been half of what it was before the incident. 

Is there anything I can ask for to make the space safer? The employees who walked in on me are employees of the building manager, and he was so hostile toward me that I'm sure he's not going to address the issue with the employees who barged in on me.",legaladvice,Sight-seeing employees barge in on mother who is nursing and call her a bitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6vvbs/sightseeing_employees_barge_in_on_mother_who_is/

I am currently renting a luxury townhouse (which ends in two months) and would like to bring in a roommate to help with the rent and utilities. I did this before about 4-5 months ago and the female tenant turned into a psycho. Didn't pay a dime of rent, utilities or food, and that's just the tame stuff.

Amy agrees, but states that they are just a little shy on money to get the business opened.

The brother has a few old misdemeanors but no felonies or anything serious. What's that about. The last remaining brother was relying on the sister for information on the case so he had been kept in the dark about more than he realized.

I’m involved in a divorce matter. I’m currently no longer represented by an attorney. The opposing party is. 

At the time I was being represented, I was being billed by my attorney for each and every email sent to her from the opposing counsel. Many of those emails were either just forwarded to me, or not responded to. My attorney also charged me for phone calls she received from the opposing counsel. Because my ex-spouse committed a criminal act against me in the middle of the divorce process, I had filed a restraining order against him. He had to go through a pre-trial diversion program which also meant every time he completed a stipulation my attorney would send me a copy of the documents via email and charge me, even though I was already getting hard copies mailed to me directly from the Clerk of courts.

Attorney 2:

\-Quoted a rate of $1400 ($1200 if I pay more upfront) $350 upfront, then $100 per month until $1400 is paid (or $1200). 

\-States he has a high chance to get the entire case dismissed and I wouldn't have to pay anything, but no guarantee. Might have to pay something, but didn't talk numbers. 

\-States since summons is only for 1 of the 2 accounts, he will only focus on that account so it's possible they could sue again, or not.

I am currently working for an electric company in the state of Texas as a business analyst and facing some issues. 

So about a year ago my previous manager was let go because she was failing as a manager. 

After this was resolved a position came open to replace her. To give a little backstory my husband of 6 years also works at the company. He has worked for the company for thirteen years and I have worked for the company for eight years, neither of us have ever worked for the same team or group within the company.

The business decided that they would choose my husband as my old managers replacement, since he has a vast amount of knowledge and has been nicknamed “The Fixer” because he’s known for picking up teams and fixing them up. Prior to the transition he me with the VP of our operations group and the Senior manager of our team, he expressed that he did not wish to join the team if it caused issues for myself in the future, if they didn’t understand that we would be taking PTO at the same time for vacations and if there was going to be any small thought that there was somehow favoritism involved. Both the VP and Senior Manager agreed this wouldn’t be an issue and even sought counsel from our highest ranking HR manager whom said this would be okay. 



A few months ago I was approached by my husband and the Senior manager with an opportunity to transfer to another group. There was a small raise which I declined because it was going end up being harder work with not enough extra revenue being pulled in (besides I love what I currently do). After declining life went on and that was the last of it. 

In July my mother passed away from Covid, I obviously took a week off to get my life together and returned to work. My husband took a day off to go to the funeral with me and returned to work the following day. This pas week my husband took two days off work (13th and 15th and I worked from home on the 15th to save on gas. When he returned to work on the 16th he was approached By the vice president of the company and questioned why he took two days off of work after a baby a big project. His response was that he had not taken time off during the passing of his mother-in-law because of the project and needs some time to handle personal business. 

He then questioned why it was such a big deal when there was another member within our same organization that had taken a week off to go to Disneyland. This was mentioned within a managers meeting in front of my husband as well as other managers when the employee requested to take the time off the vice president advised that it would be OK during that time. The vice president then went on to question my husband and say that it was an issue that we were on the same team and then he was my superior because we were taking time off at the same time. But we had already mentioned this when my husband was hired as a manager And covered this concern. He was then advised by the vice presidentThat I should be looking for another role within the organization because this was not working out. I have no history of causing issues or getting a new type of disciplinary actions since I’ve been at this company so we were both and sure why I was being moved. I was also never spoken to in regards to how I felt about the situation in my boss being my manager. The business made this decision and now my career is in jeopardy because of this, we are both thinking that they are either going to let me go or transfer me to another department because of this issue. 

We are a latino couple that happens to be homosexual and are looking to see if our rights are being violated in anyway.

In June of 2019, my daughters father abandoned her after we had a confrontation about him lying to me about our child’s well-being and bringing harm to his spouse. 
To give a little background, him and I dated briefly, he cheated a bunch, was incredibly abusive, I fell pregnant and he somewhat took responsibility. I offered a paternity test which he refused and he refused to sign the birth certificate after she was born. We frequently disagreed and when we did, he’d always resort to threatening to take my daughter away, but things did get somewhat better after he married his (now Ex) wife and we coparented somewhat smoothly. Her and I were close friends and all was well, he paid 300$ monthly cash payments for her care and wellbeing. I was content with our agreement until for about a year, he was bringing my child home sick every weekend causing the rest of my family (husband, new baby, and I) to become sick every time he brought her home. I finally became frustrated and asked what the deal was to which he responded that my child drank bad milk or had been getting sick from us(I am a stay at home parent and she was 3 at the time so this was unlikely.) His wife and I hadn’t talked for a while due to an argument he spun and out of nowhere, she had come to me June of 2019 telling me that she had been running a daycare from her home to make money due to him withholding finances from and that was the source of my daughter coming home ill so frequently. She spilled to me that my ex was cheating on her and that he had not been caring for my daughter since he married her right after my daughter was born, she was the sole caretaker of my child on weekends and my ex would hardly interact with her. He would pick up extra shifts at work (whatever no big deal) and go hang out with friends on his weekends. She disclosed to me that him and her had been arguing frequently and that on one occasion he had sped down the interstate with my child in the car threatening to kill everyone in the vehicle. History was repeating itself, he threatened suicide numerous times before our daughter was born in attempts to manipulate me. I confronted him calmly and lovingly about his lies, expressed my disappointment calmly and rationally, and told him that we would be taking a break from overnight visitation until he could iron out stuff with his mental health and with his wife. They left and within minutes she had called me screaming and crying claiming she was in danger, I could hear him screaming at her I  the background, I had them pull over, I had words with him, picked his wife up and had her stay with us. He tried to commit suicide after she discovered proof of him cheating on her and he blamed me telling everyone that I told him to do it which I proved that I did not via screenshots of old texts messages. After he got out of the hospital he tried to reconcile with his wife telling her that they’d have a child together so he wouldn’t need to deal with me anymore and stated numerous times over the phone that he no longer wanted a relationship with his daughter because he hated me for “ruining his life” I only helped his wife. I never belittled him. I was never contemptuous towards him. I told him weekly that we were family because we had a daughter together. My daughter was devastated that her dad wouldn’t talk to her anymore. She was 3 and too young for me to understand th situation. Shortly after, a false cps report was filed against us claiming that my husband molested my daughter. My husband is in the military and had to stay in the barracks for a week while my daughter underwent invasive testing. We were left broken and traumatized.2 years and no contact later, I am questioning whether or not I should contact him to fulfill his obligations to our daughter financially. However I am scared for my child’s well-being and am afraid my ex would try to keep me from moving with my husband if we eventually had to PCS to another base.

We will be staying with my bfs family in our own room and I already have a plan to relatively quickly transition us into a stable apartment and give us the best life we can have. I will be doing contracting work and making hundreds per job almost daily, it’s all set in stone. My bfs dad is the kindest person I’ve ever met second only to my bf and is more than happy to let me and my brother stay their spare bedroom as long as we need. I actually will be working with him for the contracting. I also have my own car and although I have a provisional license, I am allowed to drive myself and my little brother to school/work, and in three months I’ll be able to take the drivers test and get my full license. I’ve began collecting what little evidence I do have which is primarily screenshots of searches he has made on his devices to see his step daughter (my older sisters nudes) an email which I have been documenting as much detailed abuse as possible, me and my brothers testimony (I found a local facility that will help with getting my brothers testimony and they do it in a very comforting non pressuring way and they film it so he doesn’t have to repeat it to fifty different people and they can help me get my brother into counseling. So far legally all I understand about guardianship is that to prove I can handle him I need to show I can provide housing, essentials, medical care, and stability. For immediate housing, we have a spare bedroom at my bfs house however I have a clear and detailed plan of the work that I 100% will be doing and a list of apartments that one we will move in to when I have the money. Since I will be working Immediately I will be able to provide clothes, food, doctors visits etc and someone who is willing to support us as back up. Stability wise, again I will be stable working and have options for a second job on top of that. I plan on enrolling my brother immediately in counseling through the facility that will help with the interview. I myself am mentally stable and ever since I was his age I’ve been raising him myself. I changed His diapers fed him bottles and food put him to sleep gave him baths and have always been his emotional support. He would tell anyone if asked that I am here for him and the one he goes to and he has stated in the past without me even prompting the conversation that he wants to live with me. 

I just really need to figure out what the legalities here are and what the process will look like and what steps I need to take for that and how to get a guardianship lawyer if I need one. Additionally I need to decide if we leave this month or if we are willing to wait in this hell hole another two months to see if our mom who has temporarily moved in will be able to get a house (see other post for current situation details) and hopefully not relapse. But again their are a million things that can go wrong with her and I originally planned on after we move in with her taking my brother anyways just it would be easier from her house and I wouldn’t have to burden my bf and his dad.

I am starting my third year at a small and relatively new university that I love with all my heart. We have an extensive study abroad program, and I will be studying in Europe this coming semester. We do not have a campus, rather a residential building that we rent from other organizations to house the students. 

Over the last year (on top of the pandemic), I have been sexually harassed, stopped talking with one of my parents, started having nightmares every night, became super sensitive to sounds/sensory overload (pretty much any loud or repetitive sound sends me into a panic attack), saw someone die, went to 5 different therapists, was diagnosed with depressive disorder, anxiety + panic disorder, and agoraphobia, my parents got divorced, and a lot of other things have happened. 

I requested individual housing for the next semester for the above reasons. I have had to share a room for this time and I haven't slept through the night in months. However, my school declined my request for an individual room due to lack of availability. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, I thought they were legally required to grant reasonable accommodation requests but they state that you can only receive it based on availability. 

Apparently I am not the only student who has had this request denied (I know of at least 4 others) but the school does have an issue with people applying when they don't actually need individual rooms.

Im 22F, living in the Midwest of the United States. I can specify the state if that is important. 

In February of 2020, I needed new glasses. I went to Lenscrafters and got a pair. The total amount was $384.32. That was more money than I had at the time, so the salesperson helping me recommended this payment plan with a bank. You pay it off in six months, then close the account and that's it! It sounded great so I signed up for it.

As of today, August of 2021, I've paid them over $500. I sent them a message in May of 2021 saying I wanted my account closed and to leave me alone because I had paid off the glasses and I don't know why I ""owe"" them money. The account was closed and that was the end of it.

Until this month, when I started receiving daily texts and emails with ""friendly reminders"" to make a payment. I looked at the receipt, and I would not be charged interest if I paid in full within 6 months, which I did not do because I didn't calculate for myself how much I needed to pay to make that happen. So since, I didn't do that, I'm being charged 29.99% APR. My dad said that I've probably just been paying interest and haven't even chipped into the cost of the glasses yet. 

My current balance is $299.29 and the minimum payment they want by Sep. 2 is $118. 

I don't know what to do. I just called them earlier today and the representative didn't seem to understand my question at all, which was, ""Why am I still being hounded to make a payment when the account is closed? What do you want from me?"" All he did was take me off the text and call list. 

I feel like I've been scammed. I'm afraid to just make the payments for the balance and the minimum payment for next month because then they'll just tell me again in October that it's time to make a payment! I just want out of this.

I was given the title to a mobile home by friends with the understanding that I would be paycheck to paycheck and unable to assist with anything that may need be done, but was assured they would handle anything that may come up. They were unable to transfer the lot lease into my name due to the trailer not passing a retail inspection and after six months of being promised work would be done on the trailer, and being stood up nearly every time, and the money I was giving them not going to bills (A demand for possession was even served at one point) they offered for me to leave and sign the trailer back over to them. I told them I wanted to meet at the Secretary of State to ensure this is done properly.  

Now that I am out of the trailer and living in an apartment they stated they are going to be signing over the title to a friend who has the funds to fix up the trailer and get it to pass an inspection, however they are refusing to meet at the Secretary of State and are insisting that I just sign the title back over to them blank and drop it off. 

I know there are protections for vehicle titles where if I have a copy of the signed over title with both parties signatures that I'd be protected from any liability but I can't find anything for this regarding a mobile home title. 

Would I be protected from liability if I'm able to get a copy of the title with all parties signatures? Or do I need to meet them at Secretary of State to make sure this gets done?

Back in March of 2020 I noticed that several health insurance claims for my family and myself were being denied with no Explanation of Benefits letter being provided. I called the insurance company to find out what was going on and after some research they realized that even though that had been collecting my insurance premium every month, they did not show me as an active member in their system. 

After the issue was fixed with their system, I requested that they reprocess all of the denied claims, they did, some, not all... Meanwhile they completely ignored roughly $10,000 in medical claims. 

I requested that they reprocess those claims they missed, they haven't.

At this point I begin receiving notices from collection agencies that I must pay the full balance since my insurance company has not paid. 

I filed a complaint with the Office of the insurance commissioner, they were clueless and accepted a response from the health insurance company stating ""All of the claims have been process and paid"" as a satisfactory resolution and closed my complaint immediately. I pointed out that the information provided was false and requested to speak to the commissioner but my request was ignored. 

I tried to find an attorney to help me with this Bad faith/breach of contract case but no attorney wants to  work on a case with an amount so small, all the attorneys I've spoken to have shown interest in assisting me until they hear it's only $10,000 in unpaid invoices. 

I sent an Intent to sue letter to my insurance company requesting that they address the unpaid claims immediately, no response. 

I filed a civil suite in my local Magistrate court against the insurance company and the Sheriff Department has marked it undeliverable even though it's a massive building and I provided all of the correct information.

I started when I was 16 and the owner listed his family as working for tax reasons but they didn’t. When I was 24, I got precancer in my stomach that had been making me vomit everyday for months. I cut down my time to three days and a week later, the owner fired me for not making food 15 minutes to close. It was definitely just a reason to get rid of and replace me as there was always freedom to make our own decisions as closers. Anyways, I asked him how to go about getting unemployment and he said that he couldn’t help me because I technically never existed as an employee. The feeling of betrayal got to me, I was going through a lot of suffering with my health and I had known this man since my childhood (my older sister worked for him too), so my dumb-ass emailed that if he didn’t give me some form of unemployment, that I’d report him to the IRS. He sent me one week’s pay and then immediately reported me for blackmail to the police. I was arrested, held for a day, bonded out.

Since I have never had a charge, PTI was available to me. I applied in May and they asked for an SS card. I had to retrieve my birth certificate from my estranged parents to get it and because of COV-ID, the process took too long for PTI. The PTI employee told me I might be able to re-apply but I’d need to make sure that I had my SS card ready to go before I did. I finally got my SS card and I called my public defender yesterday. She said PTI is no longer and option and now the offer I have, until the 20th of August (this friday) is if I plead guilty, I’ll get time served. But I’ll be a felon for at least the next ten years.

I’m devastated. The public defender doesn’t seem to have any other options besides pleading guilty. I know she probably doesn’t care about what happens since this has been going on for two years and COV-ID stalled all the court procedures. I’m devastated that PTI is suddenly not an option for me. If I agree to this, by Friday I will be a convicted felon at 26 for something that sounds so horrible for the truth of the situation.

Hi all hope your all well,
 I could really do with some advice please,

Im a separated dad of a 3 year old 
My daughter lives with her mum and I saw her every week for 2/3 days up until February,for the 4th time or so she stopped access for non sensical reasons
Enough was enough and me and my at time partner(who’s now switched sides,and wrote a statement against me in court)actioned a c100 on her to get proper access in concrete,I am unrepresented,as I don’t have the funds to pay for a solicitor and don’t think I qualify for legal aid 
My daughters mum is represented by a Solicitor as she is entitled to legal aid 
6 months down the line still not seen my daughter and being battered by her solicitor and now 2 bitter ex partners(one being my child’s mum) and other my recent ex partner) both I was with for 4 years,I have managed upto now myself in 3 separate hearings,and Scott schedules completed and responded to on both sides,my most recent hearing it was ordered/directed that the court wanted 2 police reports and referenced the two incidents and specific dates,my daughters mums solicitor was in charge of collecting this,I’ve received a letter from him saying I need to pay 50% of the costs for this as the court said at the time,fine,but he’s given me a breakdown of 6 different occasions,where she has phoned the police mostly very recent,the two incidents the court want are
 1.
when we broke up and I took my daughter,police called my at the time and no concerns as I’m her father,had somewhere to take her and had clothes,food money etc,I returned my daughter to her mum 2 days later 
2. Around 2/3 years after our breakup she told me she was having serious mental health problems and I had cause for concern then a week or so later stopped all access again,I spoke with her/her family and wanted to simply know my daughter was safe via a video call or phone call or to see her,all was denied I then traveled upto my daughters house which is one hour away,to seek to see she’s safe,I was not allowed,so phoned the police and had a welfare check carried out,whilst I was waiting for police to turned up,my child’s mother called police I believe, to claim harassment,the police turned up for my welfare check as requested after a few hours,confirmed she was fine and left and so did I,since then she has phoned the police on several occasions and her solicitor is trying to make me pay 50% of the costs of all the police logs in existence,am I right in thinking I only need to pay for the two as ordered/directed by the court and not the other 4-5 that she has done since,sorry for the ramble",legaladvice,Please help child law advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6tsci/please_help_child_law_advice/

So my MIL and FIL owned and ran a very successful business and were quite wealthy for around 15 years, then they lost everything in the 2008 crash. When I say everything, I mean people coming and kicking them out of their house and not having a place to live for almost a year. 

About a month ago, MIL told me that she did not pay taxes for her business. I don’t know if that spanned the entirety of them owning and running it (I doubt it because they were so successful for so long it seems unlikely it would go unnoticed, but I don’t really know anything about it), or if it was just once everything started going south in the economy.
 
Either way, she let it slip that she was audited for a long time by an IRS employee who swore he would find an inconsistency in her taxes, and after years, paid off the employee who promised her she would never be audited again, which she hasn’t been.

So I have a couple questions:

1. She claims she had set up a $1M life insurance policy for both her sons long before the market crash that she is “reluctant to keep for him if he moves too far away,” is that likely still eligible or is that something she’s just using to keep her son close to home? Would she have been able to access that money when she was trying to save the business (she invested $250k of her own money into the business as it first started to go downhill)? I don’t really know how life insurance policies like that work. And yes I know how toxic her behavior is but that is for a different conversation. 

2. When she dies (which may be soon) will her tax evasion be noticed or looked into, and will my husband and his brother be responsible for anything related to it? We just don’t want to get financially f***** because she never paid taxes. He and his brother were never directly involved with their business as they were still in high school when they lost the business. 

I would ask her these questions myself but it would start a lot of drama with her, but it is deeply concerning to both my husband and I.

We moved out of my apartment a couple weeks ago and it was what I thought was a smooth process where we hid the keys in a secure location for the landlord to pick up at a later time. Due to a lack of judgment and mistakening trusting the landlord, we did not record a video after moving out and the landlord was there in person due to covid. 

Now the landlord has sent us video of a scene of damage being to the property. We do not recognize any of the items that were in the picture that apparently were dropped and damaged the flooring and walls. The apartment was completely empty when we left. 

It either may be staged or someone got access to the apartment between us leaving the keys and the landlord picking up the keys. They would've damaged the property and put the keys back...

We're unsure if the landlord will pursue just the deposit or for more damage. Should we start calling lawyers at this point? What else should we do to prepare? 

We're intending the landlord to retain the items causing the damage and maybe having them finger printed to prove we didn't do it.

The long and short is I canceled a personal training program after about 5 months/12-month program because I hated the coach. In the contract the cancellation policy is written as:

""Due to the upfront cost of third party software usage for client plans you will be billed $500 for a cancellation prior to the 3 month agreement""

Because no cancellation policy was ever mentioned during our initial calls with this trainer, when we (my fiance and I ) read that policy we understood it to mean we agreed not to cancel within the first 3 months or we would be charged.

The trainer is now saying, oh that is just a mistake since you were signed up for the 12 month program. It should have said 12 and wants to charge us 1,000 dollars to cancel. In addition, he is charging us the monthly fee even AFTER we have expressed we are done with the program and he is not coaching at all.

The only legally binding\* (edit from typo) item is the contract that we signed, which says 3 months. Regardless of what he ""meant"" for it to say. We discussed with a lawyer and they confirmed that since our understanding was reasonable that is what a court would rule with because in the end the contract is wrong and we understood the contract's policy in a way that was plausible and reasonable.  


We are in Maine and he is in California. We feel like fighting this with a lawyer officially would cost way more than what the cancellation charge is but, also feel like he's proken his contract in the services he promised to render before we chose to cancel and that is why we ultimately wanted to cancel.

Location: WA State and CA

I have been awarded attorney fees in a settled case. 

I’ve spoken to a few law firms that specialize in recovery however their fees to track down assets would outweigh the benefit of collection. The ROI just doesn’t reconcile and I stand to be upside down even if they do collect the total sum. 

Is there any other mechanism to recover these fees myself?  My Googling only gets me as far as a collection agency, which does have a more reasonable fee model but doesn’t seem to have the authority to place liens on assets  or levy bank accounts but said they can successfully garnish wages.   However, I have read that child support garnishments would supersede secondary garnishment but I don’t fully understand if that means they can’t be garnished at all or only up to a percent of overall wage. 

The attorney fees awarded are under 5k, however the losing party owes me a substantial amount of money outside of these fees that I can sue for in small claims court and am confident I would prevail on. The total to collect  would then be ~10k.  I’m  owed far more than that but small claims has limits. 


Do I go through small claims and then collect the total sum at once?  

Can I request the Sheriffs office seize personal property? 

What is the best strategy here?

This is land that has always been promised to him as he upkeeps the property for free in addition to multiple forms of labor that the parents had promised to pay him for, however they have failed to pay him since January.

This demand didn’t come until weeks later when she had uprooted her and her children’s lives to move from Arizona to Oregon, where they have been living in the boyfriends one bedroom. 

Here’s some details which add to why this particularly is so suspicious, the boyfriend has allot of firearms/gun powder/ explosive materials on the property and this is something the community and local fire department are aware of, making it an almost impossible situation if there was a fire on the property.

Once I told my landlord about the bats, he hired a critter remover and the landlord has been really shady, telling the bat guy to not show us pics and not updating us at all.

The reason I want to sue is bc I was in and out of the hospital for months this year with chronic respiratory failure. I'm better now but the docs never figured out what was causing it. I asked my doctors if they thought it could have been from the bats and they said they don't know, it's too late to tell.

This has been the worst year of my life, to the point where I had a mental breakdown and took FMLA leave from work. In addition to the multiple hospitalizations, the steroids they were treating me with caused osteoporosis, so even though my lungs are healed, I'm still affected by the ordeal bc I broke the shit out of my leg last month from a minor fall.

Anyway, my insurance paid most of the costs, but the cost was literally 10s of thousands of dollars — probably close to $100K all added up. I personally paid a few thousand, not to mention the emotional trauma. But there's no way to know for sure that the bats caused it, though I think it's likely.

My hot water fixture in the shower quit working, wouldn't shut off the water flow and needed repairing. Since I was able to reach the pipe shut off, I was able to shut off the hot water in my bathroom and notified my Landlady. She is the type of penny pincher that clogs the hallway with 20 year old paint and pieces of lumber that will never be used. She had a spare handle that matched my fixture but it was a bigger issue and we decided to get a plumber in. She waited a week knowing I was leaving for a long vacation before contacting anyone. I'm super uncomfortable with her so it was hard convincing me to let her and workers be in my apartment without me around. I let her know I put cameras in the kitchen/entry and bedroom and she would have the unit to do repairs. 

I've been gone 3 weeks and I've caught her opening my dresser, each of 6 drawers. She's opened my closets. She's brought EVERYTHING from the entry, including a broken dresser that's used to collect mail, into the bedroom with no explanation. There are piles in every corner of my room with her things. I've reached out via text since I'm overseas and she has responded with a breakdown of repairs being done. Currently, I'll be back on Friday and still see the piles and furniture in my bedroom, nothing has happened since Sunday.

Also, the repairs have been during the evening, one being 9pm-12am that the camera had movement. Not sure if that makes a difference, the units above are renters and she lives below me.

I have recently completed all coursework required for my degree, including a cluster in (name changed) Basketweaving. A cluster consists of  6 specified courses (it is essentially the same thing as a minor, however, due to legal/administrative reasons at the university, they cannot legally call it a minor). One of these courses (call it UB200, intro to underwater basketweaving, course name changed for privacy), I received a C in, which is a passing grade and a satisfaction as a prerequisite. 

As this was the only C I received for my cluster, I found a form on the university website called a ""Course Forgiveness form"". This form states the following relevant points. There are others I can provide if requested, but I do not see their relevance to this post. 
* Students may forgive any three courses. **provided that they are not required for their major** (emphasis mine).
* Any forgiven courses and the assigned grades remain on the transcript, but the grades are not calculated into the students cumulative grade point average.
* Forgiveness is retroactive but must be done before graduation.
* Forgiveness cannot be unforgiven.

The same relevant points were verbatim on the course forgiveness form that I signed and gave to the registrar. No additional points were added. 

In short, this form allows for a student to have 3 grades removed from their GPA calculation, but the course remains on their transcript. I took advantage of this to have the grade for UB200 removed from my GPA calculation.

When it came time for my degree audit, I was informed that UB200 could not be used for ANY credit whatsoever. I appealed the decision, on the basis that the wording explicitly states that course forgiveness cannot be used for courses required for a **major**. It says nothing concerning a cluster or minor. I asked if an exception could be made to the policy due to the unclear wording, and I be allowed to ""take back"" the form and have the C reinstated on my transcript, and receive credit for the cluster. This too was denied. 

My appeals have been escalated to the provost, and all appeals have been met with the same response: (paraphrased) 
&gt; Your request to undo the course forgiveness has been denied.

When I talked to the provost concerning this, they explained that ""they can't list EVERYTHING that the form applies or doesn't apply to, so I should have known what it meant.""

I have asked each level to provide me a reference to any wording that explicitly states what they claim. They refuse to acknowledge the vague wording of the form, or provide a reference to an explanation of why the form also applies to my cluster. I have escalated this to the highest level at the university, and have been met with the same responses. 

I feel as though I am wronged.

I'll  just get to the point, I'll share my post exactly as is and fill in  what the responce has been so far. This post was made to a local  neighbourhood's facebook page. This business has been abusive to every  single employee who's ever walked through their door myself included.  I've been gone for a few months now but after hearing what happened to  somebody very close to me I felt compelled to speak out. Since I've made  this post, many of the ex-employees have reached out to thank me for  speaking out. A girls mom even reached out to me to thank me. People are  bringing up occurences of their experiences with seeing the owners  being abusive towards their employers. Many employees are speakig out on  the post. The admin of the page even made a comment saying that many  ex-employees were reaching out to her to corroborate my story.

I  just want to know if this can land me in legal trouble? If so, would  having the support of so many ex-employees grant me some sort of  security? I am in Quebec so if anybody is familiar with this type of  situation I'd really love to hear from you. The post has been live since  last night and there's been an enormous amount of support.

""  Been  debating writting something like this for a long time. If this  isn't  allowed I'm sorry, it'll be removed. I just wanted to talk a bit  about  my experience about a certain Organic Grocery store named XXXXX.   Many of you likely have wonderful experiences with this place and view   it as a wholesome store with awesome people in it. I can assure you, on   the surface that's exactly what it is. XXXXX's staff has always been   amazing, kind, thoughtful, and most of all carring.

Where  the  praise ends is with the management. The two owners of this store  have  time and time again proven to be disrespectful people who  FREQUENTLY are  abusive towards their employees. I can't even begin to  list the number  of times my colleagues have been disrespected and  gaslite. I've been  gone from this place for a little while now but I  keep in touch with all  the people I worked with. Many of them have very  recently quit (which  was a long time coming). They think the mass  quitting is all  orchestrated by an EX emplyee which is just madness.  The mass quitting  is because of their a\*hole behaviour.

I  have a lot of valuable  work experience. I've worked in gyms, managed a  small business, worked  in a municipality, graduated university. I can  assure you, the behaviour  in this establishment is abnormal and  unacceptable. Period. I have  never in my life worked in such a toxic  place. It's honestly kind of  weird, they'll do many nice things for  their staff but some kindness  does not erase the horrible. The Bad  comes in waves. For a few weeks it  seems fine, then all of a sudden it  is chaos, people are depressed,  insulted and the next abusive acts  occurs. **If a place leads with** ***""Here we're a family"" odds are it's because they're comfortable bullying you.***

During my time at Ecollogey these are some of the things I've experienced:

* My intellect has been insulted.
* ***Throwing objects was common.***
* Manic screaming was common.
* My colleagues were bullied.
* Everybody was gaslit regularly.
* Following   employees around the store to berate them occured many times to the   point of  a) warning of an oncoming panic attack by said employee***s*** b) causing a panic attack***s***

None of that is normal. None of that should be acceptable. ***None of it should be financially supported.***  
I   honestly hope they see this post and it serves as a wake up call. It's   time to either retire or hire somebody to manage your business and  stay  500 feet away at all times.

So two weeks ago at my place of work I met a car sales woman whom inevitably helped me buy my first car. 
We got it all included for 7000$. 
This car is paid, signed and I am sitting in it right now. 

Today they called me back. They said they made a mistake and I owe them 100$ (They accidentally charged me 6900$). They said it was a human error (on their part) and that I needed to come in to make payment or money was going to be missing somewhere. 

I asked for the numbers and clarified that I was going to be checking if I actually /needed/ to pay it. Because lets be real, usually when companies make an error, customers don't foot the bill. 

Obviously the lady didnt like that, but she didn't contest it. She only mentioned that this has happened before and that /usually/ people have a good heart and come back to make the payment. 

Now, I saw how this car concession worked. It wasn't bustling with people and I spent most of my time waiting and they seemed very disorganized. And let's be real. Money missing? C'mon.

I felt something was a little off when I made my profile - you need to purchase a premium membership to view other members pictures and send text messages, and the only membership options are limited to; 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years. But I got several profile hits when I first registered, and i’m aware that some dating apps use paywalls to deter non-serious members from flooding the match pool, so I thought I’d give it a try. Also, although many said they had negative experiences with the service, they have 13,000+ reviews on the Apple App Store with a 4 star rating, and many claimed they found their now wife/husband using the app, so I suspected that many of the negative reviews were from people bitter that they were unable to make a match. 

I was very wrong, as there are very few members within 30 miles to begin with. Most of my visitors were from extremely far away, so I feel like I was mislead, because even under the free version you can set your search preferences for &lt;30 miles.

Do I have any options to get out of paying?

I thought maybe I could cancel my visa: I’m paying in a 4 payment plan through PayPal, and if I cancel my visa this would cut the head of the snake. However, doing this, I suspect that they’ll try to bring me to collections for nonpayment, so I doubt this will be effective.

Someone said to try to get my account banned: I thought I would post things on my profile that violate their membership agreement and they would have no choice but to terminate my membership. In such a case, would I still be liable to pay the remaining 3 payments (over $150…).

I feel like I was blatantly lied to, and that their services fall under false advertising - they claim “someone finds love every 14 minutes on eHarmony,” sucker you into an expensive long term membership, only for you to find out that and what they advertise is impossible, as their app is a literal ghost town.",legaladvice,Ways to get around paying for eHarmony subscription?

Basically, because the pedo is a computer software engineer at a hospital he has access and knowledge of laptops, servers, and work phones that he has personal storage on. Cops have no way of breaking in to the phone that was used in the crime because in the pedos words, “If you are smart enough you will easily be able to get into my phone” a phone that has 2-step verification, face-id, and thumbprints not to mention different cloud storage systems that could hold any number of pictures or videos. So my question is what will it take for this fucker to be institutionaliz? Does my sister and her friend’s families have to press chargers for this to go anywhere? The man thinks hes smart and has been outsmarted every step of the way but I cant help but feel that makes a man dangerous, especially when he has “attempted” suicide with a plastic bag but has weapons and ammunition.

The main party line of the company is that everyone should get vaccinated against COVID-19. This has been recommended and affirmed on a weekly basis for a long time.

I have asked why they don’t make it a requirement for employment(and let go any employees that refuse)and I have been told repeatedly that they can’t because it is not legal to do so under California law. 

I am not a lawyer, legal expert, or anything close to that. That being said, everything I seem to read on Reddit or the internet says that it IS legal to mandate that employees get the COVID-19 vaccination as terms of their employment, especially in California.

Because mortgage rates are so low and projected to keep raising I am trying to lockdown a good interest rate for refinancing my house and lenders have told me as long as I return to work before the first mortgage payment is due they can use my normal income but they need a letter from my work showing my projected return to work date.


So I called and talked to my point of contact for my HR department and She said that she doesn’t believe they would be able to give them my return to work date info because that is considered “protected and confidential medical information.” She said I can sign a authorization form for lender to send them a request but because I am on a medical leave that why she doesn’t think my work will be able to release my estimated return to work date.

Before I try to talk to someone higher up in the HR department is the return to work date considered legally protected medical info?

Also this is longggggg i feel you need back story of sorts to this as to why it feels weird and wrong and somehow illegal maybe? I just don't know exsacally what and need some other opinions on this please.
This is in Australia btw. Specifically Perth where covid is fairly non existent so we arnt in lockdown or had any restrictions when this took place. 

My mum has back pain issues. For the last 1 year at least she has been going to this one pain specialist doctor and a hospital in the city. She's been having small sugerys to sort of numb the nurves between her spine. Not sure on the names for it all I'm sorry. Either way she's seen him for a long time and has had multipul small sugerys with this doctor. You don't have to be fully put under for these surgerys but alot of people choose to be fully under annastetic during the procedure cause it can be very painful. 

Well one time during a normal surgery on her back during the beginning they used twilight anesthesia and then the doctor came in and gave mum a injection of lignocaine near the back of her neck as that was the joint he was working on. 
He MISSED with the needle and somehow nicked some blood vessel or vain and instead of the lignocaine going where it was ment to it shot up into her brain. 
This is not ment to happen and sort of stopped her heart from beating. They gave her adrenaline while doing CPR and ""bagging"" her and somehow I guess the lignocaine to the brain and adrenaline mixed in made her ""wake up"". 
Her eyes were open and she was relatively alert in her self but is sort of locked In her body. She couldn't move or anything. She couldn't make herself breath cause the body had shut down while the mind ran on adrenaline. She said only thing she could move was her eyeballs. So while conscious She watched the medical staff panicing trying to restart her heart which still wasn't beating right. 
She heard then shouting about giving her narcan also but isn't sure if they gave it or not. Mean while all she can think is ""oh god don't stop with that bag go faster please!!"" The bag she's referring to is the oxygen bag the nurse is using to force her lungs to breath. The nurse has to manually squeeze the bag to make a ""breath"" if that makes sence. Essentially this nurse is being my mum's lungs right now cause her body can't cause of the lignocaine injection numbing the brain to the point it can't function at all.
So. Here is my mum. Fully awake and is watching the doctors and nurses panic as they give her CPR.
They realize mum's ""awake"" and call in a trauma doctor to talk to mum to keep her calm and all that. (The hospital this took place in was NOT a emergancy hospital. It's a private hospital for elective procedures so this hospital did not have a trauma doctor on site, they called her in for my mum) 
After alot of time they got mum's heart beating normally and the lignocaine had sort of been flushed out I guess? 
Got a call from the doctors saying shit happend and to come in right away but by the end of it mum has had no physical issues from it but has some mental struggles now. Considering she watched herself get resuscitated and all that.
We were told this was a once in a lifetime mistake and it's never happend before and all that. He assures us it was ok and that things would be ok. After that mum went back to finesh the other injections since she was in chronic pain from her back (not related to that incident) but during the last 4 or so months there was another 2 ""incident"" at that hospital that ""never happend before"" which didnt involve us per say but mum was at the hospital for an infection at the time with this doctor while these 2 other incidents happend causing mums appointment to be rescheduled.
 Then mum got a call from the hospital not her doctor saying he is going on ""permanent leave"" as of now and she needs to find a new pain specialist. News article  came out later about this doctor that his ""permanent leave"" was cause he is in court cause he was giving out steroids and other unnecessary drugs and procedures to other people he saw as part of his own ran pain clinic. Cool.. (Note mum did not go threw this pain clinic. She got this doctor after her other doctor retired and recommended this doctor) 
Now after getting a new referral from our family GP for a new pain specialist she asked for ALL of her medical records be sent to the new doctor.
The issue?

Today we found ""all"" her records were sent and there was no mention at all of the events of that day. 
The lignocaine to the brain. The CPR, the possible use of Narcan as mum said while her body was tierd her brain could not stop ""buzzing around"" for 3 days from what ever drugs they gave her to wake up. The fact she WATCHED and heard these doctors argue over ""we need to send her to ICU!"" ""No we don't it's ok we can do this"" 
The fact my mum wakes up at night scared cause she thinks she forgot how to breath and all she can remember is this plastic bag and how ""damn it squeeze the bag faster your making me breath to slowly I'm going to suffocate!"" Running over and over in her brain. Yet there is no record of it. Least her new doctor dosnt know a thing about it from ""all"" of her medical records...
Mum has yet to meet this new doc in person and will be telling them this info but till then..

This HAS to be wrong? Surly there is something out there that makes it wrong to keep that info off your medical records?? Please I don't know if this even makes sence but this whole thing was terrifying for me as her kid let alone how my mum feels about being conscious while being resuscitated..please someone help me and tell me that I'm right and that this seems super wrong and we should be telling some sort of authority about this :(

To add to the problem.  We recently found out that our insurance company is undergoing a lawsuit for not properly filing claims and other problems.  We also explained this to the collectors and they told us we could pay them and then request reimbursement from the insurance company that is taking over ours.

I haven’t slept in a couple days because I’m so furious, so bare with me... I need advice desperately. And please refrain from the obvious “you need a camera, you shouldn’t have done that, you could have done this, etc.” Hindsight comments will do nothing but infuriate me. I’m begging you, for my sanity, please don’t.

I live in a pretty average little town in the US, on a somewhat private property (no houses directly behind mine). Weed is legal to grow, 6 plants allowed per adult in household, up to 12 maximum.

Never grew anything before, but last January I started 12 plants indoors for my wife and I, they were getting huge. I took incredible care of them, feeding them the best supplies, trimming as needed, lots of energy and money went into this little project, they’ve been outside since June . A couple nights ago somebody came onto my property, to my back deck (which was locked and out of sight COMPLETELY) and stole all of them. 

I work far away, with a 2.5+ hour commute, one way. My life is pretty miserable to be honest, won’t go into detail but my wife and I are working at a constant rate. We each skip two nights of sleep every week just to work enough overtime to pay our mortgage. We don’t have kids, because it will never be possible given how little time and money we have. I was in a dark place before this, and now have been pushed to my breaking point. I have nothing to look forward to, I can’t think straight I’m so upset. 

The police came, and are still investigating but it doesn’t look hopeful. They said don’t talk to anyone of my neighbors that I don’t know... I work too much to even see my family or be friendly with my neighbors or even decorate our house, (the house is still completely empty except for our bed, even though we moved in almost 4 years ago, looks and feels very depressing, like everything in my life) so I have no one to ask anything. 

I have a hunch as to which house did it. The cop even guessed before I finished that sentence. There are probably a dozen shirtless and seemingly fatherless kids at the end of the street adjacent to mine. They spend all day swearing at each other and yelling about whatever 11-16 year old kids scream about. Since I moved in, they are always riding their bikes on the next street over, but everyone in the neighborhood hears them and dislikes them. A couple weeks ago they started playing on my road, but ONLY my half of it, and I mean like constantly. I only noticed because of how rude and loud they are. As soon as this robbery took place, not a single one has come down my road. 
I have more details that point in their direction but it’s too much to type. 

I spent the last two nights wondering my neighborhood instead of sleeping, which didn’t help my already 19 hour long work days. I’m about to lose my mind. The shit hole house they all live in is very unkept and over grown... the moms’ various boyfriends stay up all night because apparently none of them work for a living and I was unable to get to/see the back of their property in my nightly investigations. 

Since the cops valued my plants at over $1000 each, they have the state attorney general involved and are investigating it pretty seriously, but unless a break comes in, their probably not gonna be able to do much.

It has become my mission to find out what happened at all costs. Life is really so unenjoyable, it doesn’t even matter to me if I get killed trying to find out. I’m completely desperate and going insane.

I’m hoping somebody can help give me an idea of how to find these idiots. 

 I have two ideas, and I’m open to anyone else’s. 

1) Put up a sign offering a cash reward for any information about the heist. I’m guessing these kids had to have bragged about it by now.

2) Making a public post on Facebook to see if anyone’s heard anything

While I don’t have time for friends, I have many who like me. I grew up in this town and was in the live music industry for years, lots of people know and like me, I just hate to air out on Facebook. But again, I’m a desperate man who has had it with the world and is not looking forward to a single thing in my life. I don’t fear death or loss because I truly have nothing to lose but credit card and mortgage debt, and 90 hour work weeks for the rest of my life, just like most of you reading this. 

 Any ideas on how I can find these scum bags would be priceless to me in my current state of severe darkness. 

Either way, thank you all so much for reading this. I pray you go onto enjoy your life even just for a couple seconds each day, and may no troubles come your way. Please be good to each other.

This post was made to a local neighbourhood's facebook page. This business has been abusive to every single employee who's ever walked through their door myself included. I've been gone for a few months now but after hearing what happened to somebody very close to me I felt compelled to speak out. Since I've made this post, many of the ex-employees have reached out to thank me for speaking out. A girls mom even reached out to me to thank me. People are bringing up occurences of their experiences with seeing the owners being abusive towards their employers. Many employees are speakig out on the post. The admin of the page even made a comment saying that many ex-employees were reaching out to her to corroborate my story. 

I just want to know if this can land me in legal trouble? If so, would having the support of so many ex-employees grant me some sort of security? I am in Quebec so if anybody is familiar with this type of situation I'd really love to hear from you. The post has been live since last night and there's been an enormous amount of support. 

"" Been  debating writting something like this for a long time. If this isn't  allowed I'm sorry, it'll be removed. I just wanted to talk a bit about  my experience about a certain Organic Grocery store named XXXXX.  Many of you likely have wonderful experiences with this place and view  it as a wholesome store with awesome people in it. I can assure you, on  the surface that's exactly what it is. XXXXX's staff has always been  amazing, kind, thoughtful, and most of all carring.   


Where the  praise ends is with the management. The two owners of this store have  time and time again proven to be disrespectful people who FREQUENTLY are  abusive towards their employees. I can't even begin to list the number  of times my colleagues have been disrespected and gaslite. I've been  gone from this place for a little while now but I keep in touch with all  the people I worked with. Many of them have very recently quit (which  was a long time coming). They think the mass quitting is all  orchestrated by an EX emplyee which is just madness. The mass quitting  is because of their a\*hole behaviour.   


I have a lot of valuable  work experience. I've worked in gyms, managed a small business, worked  in a municipality, graduated university. I can assure you, the behaviour  in this establishment is abnormal and unacceptable. Period. I have  never in my life worked in such a toxic place. It's honestly kind of  weird, they'll do many nice things for their staff but some kindness  does not erase the horrible. The Bad comes in waves. For a few weeks it  seems fine, then all of a sudden it is chaos, people are depressed,  insulted and the next abusive acts occurs. **If a place leads with** ***""Here we're a family"" odds are it's because they're comfortable bullying you.***   


During my time at Ecollogey these are some of the things I've experienced:   


* My intellect has been insulted.
* ***Throwing objects was common.***
* Manic screaming was common.
* My colleagues were bullied. 
* Everybody was gaslit regularly.
* Following  employees around the store to berate them occured many times to the  point of  a) warning of an oncoming panic attack by said employee***s*** b) causing a panic attack***s***

None of that is normal. None of that should be acceptable. ***None of it should be financially supported.***

I have been living in a house for about 12 years.  For many, money was not an issue with the house - property taxes &amp; homeowner's insurance are not terribly expensive.  The homeowner wants someone in the house so it doesn't become dilapidated or have an emergency and no one aware of it.  The homeowner typically asked for cash when it was needed, and I gladly handed it over.  At the time, up to 12 years ago, I had no reason to suspect anything else may be going on, and would be threatened with consequences if I tried to document it.  I was also recovering from a traumatic brain injury and believed the people in my life were looking out for me. 

Many years passed, with the homeowner paying the bills, including utilities, but asking for cash when needed.  In 2018, the homeowner agreed itcwas time to officially put the house in my name, as that had been the plan all along.  Tye homeowner made elaborate plans and bought a couple updates to the house, but overall, I put in about $20k of my life savings into the house.  I would hand the workers cash, her brother would often make the hardware store trips, and the homeowners kept all the receipts as documentation.  This still did not set off alarm bells.  I worked for up to 18 hours (insomnia) on the house for about 8 months before the homeowner began to change their mind.

The homeowner flipped the script on paying for updates and began calling me entitled.  The house has been in 2 stages of development for awhile because I ran out of money &amp; cannot do Airbnb hosting here anymore per all the unacceptable areas, which was my income.  (I'm in the process of applying for SSDI and the homeowner kept the Airbnb income in their name &amp; with their tax info but did make some of it available to me, mainly for continued updates to the home, never as income I could keep or spend as I wished.) 

E.g.:  The homeowner believes a sheetrock ceiling is a waste of money, even though I have friends willing to do the work &amp; all they'd need to buy is materials (estimated to be about $700/room, there are 3 rooms with falling tiles.  I'veasked for 1 room at a time as the homeowner &amp; her pensioned father can pay for it, and been turned down).  The tiles have broken my things when falling and some landed on my Service Dog another time.  The ceiling tiles are essentially 70+ year old thick cardboard.  The pieces crumble and fall apart when handles.  I leave the broken pieces outside because a large colony of roly polies seems to enjoy eating them.  There is absolutely no way these ""tiles"" can be stapled or secured back in place after they fall, as the homeowner suggests.  The homeowner has been unwavering on this issue of ceilings being necessary. 

In the last couple years, every repairs needed to the old house has run me over $100 and sometimes upwards of $600.  Other months have multiple problems.  I'm disabled and have no income, and ithe issues have gotten to the point where I've had to choose bug spray &amp; fly strips over OTC medications &amp; food I can actually eat.  There was a major fly infestation from a box of produce I kept on the porch.  There is a 3/4"" gap underneath the door feom the outside to the porch, and rotting wood around the newer frame which allows for direct access for critters to wander straight inside the porch.  I have completely cleaned it several times, but the homeowner scoffs and says not to use the porch if it attracts insects.  I still have not recovered from the fly infestation because *soooooo* many thousands of flies were killed, the surfaces in thd porch and kitchen need an absolutely thorough wipe down.  I cannot for the supplies needed to do this much work, and it's made eating almost impossible because I can't properly clean the kitchen.  The homeowner, when asked for help in the past, would often scold that ""these are the costs of living in a home, they're your responsibility because you live there!""  But ultimately they'd pay for a halfass solution that solves part of the problem.  Reporting home issues to the homeowner is useless, at this point.  

I have asked to pay the bills. (I get a low income discount on multiple services that the homeowner cannot.)  I have begged to put the bills in my name, again, largely to save a couple hundred dollars per month for them, and to have some responsibility in owning the house in a serious way.  After numerous excuses, the homeowner ultimate relented, claiming, ""You get the house in my will, okay?  Now drop it.""

Since that point, the homeowner has remained ""no contact"" with me, other than to drop off a note (unrelated to the home) here and there.  The homeowner enters the property illegally because ""it's legal to break into your own house and I own the house"" and never with 24 hours notice because they ""don't have to, I'm not a tenant.""  If my home phone or Wifi are down, I cannot contact the ISP myself because only the account holder is able.  Same with utilities.  If the power is out, I cannot get through the automated phone system to a live human because I don't have the account details.  

Lately my friends and I have also been trying to epically make up for overdue erosion help with the yard.  It's not the kind of problem that developed in the last 10 years; it's been neglected for 50+ and finally gotten to the point that the erosion is ultimately going to threaten the house.  There is a majorly steep slope on one side, and the only solution is a retaining wall.  The homeowner definitely will not put the $10-15k weaker estimates into consideration, even though I had agreed to pay part of it.

I cannot change the bills to be in my name, but the ""tradeoff"" is I get to live in a house with ""all expenses paid.""  On paper, I look like my existence is completely paid for.  But I pay more than the homeowner, they refuse discounts, &amp; ultimately because I don't have tenant's rights, it just stays this way.  (Homeowner has been no contact since December 2020 and isn't dead or anything, the individual has *always* been combative by nature; worse as they get older.)  I spend 50+ hours on this house, doing piddly ""work"" with much cheaper solutions that I simply cannot buy and the homeowner refuses.  Anything that breaks or needs repaired is considered ""the cost of living in a house"" and is exprcted to be covered by me ""because the homeowner pays for everything else.""  

I was recently diagnosed with (Adult) Failure To Thrive.  Half of my doctors want me to have a feeding tube (G-tube) placed while others think a picc line for fluids with me still managing my nutrition can be enough.  Either way, I'm in the lowest 1 percentile for human weight.  My doctors made it official that they're worried.  And I don't have enough energy to keep this up, or the cognitive faculties half the time.  I finally thought I had the fly infestation fixed, only to feel a maggot squirming on my leg because I was crouched on the floor cleaning.  I proceeded to collect almost 4 dozen more, and dozens more fly ""coccoons.""  (The phase between a maggot &amp; a fly looks like a dark little grain of rice so you have to sweep &amp; crunch all of those or they will become flies.)  That ended up taking 6 hours - to look under *every* dark place &amp; find them &amp; kill them.  Not to mention really freaking disgusting.  I told my doctors that if I walk into the kitchen hungry and see a fly, I lose my appetite.  I told my doctors I don't have enough resources, even with food stamps, to get as much nutrition as they want me to have.  

I've worked so hard on this house, and it's the only thing I know, at this point.  Moving would almost be impossible and it would just result in the homeowner getting to keep all of my ""preps"" because I cannot afford help moving and couldn't move everything in a month.  My doctors won't refer me to a social worker or any local organizations that might be able to help.  My primary care physician took my physiatrist's diagnosis of FTT as him being overly dramatic ""because I've always been thin.""  My GI doctors recommended cognitive behavioral therapy and refused to discuss IV fluids or a G-tube. 

I just want peace and to be left alone, and not harassed to the point it's easier to beg my friends for help with the house than ask the homeowner.  It's very hard to document that friends spend hours upon hours doing free work for me.  I don't have receipts from everything they've bought me.  I just know that if I was actually a tenant, the law wouldn't treat me like a worthless leech lucky to be ""living off of"" someone else.  I have no rights, as it stands now.  And I've been completely on my own to manage everything for almost 9 months now.

As an additional note, I don't think the homeowner is actually going to will me the house at this point.  I think they will either give the house to someone else completely or force me to split the house with that person.  That person will allow me two choices: a quick sale where we split the profits 50/50 or have me to buy out the other half... aka that person directly profits from my financial and work investments into the house.  The $20k in improvements, for example, raised the value of the home, so every time I imptove the home, it just feels further and further from actually being mine.  I've lost so much in my life, and I've already been terminally ill before (not with FTT).  FTT isn't terribly uncommon with the extensive medical treatments of my past.  At this rate, the homeowner will likely outlive me (I'm 30) and it was all irrelevant anyway.  I don't think I can physically handle anymore change, and I don't have a way to move, or to financially keep up with not-my-house I've lived in &amp; cared for for 12 years.

Is there a way I can become a tenant to at least have a couple rights while existing in someone else's house?  I worry that if I just, leave, the homeowner will sue me for damages and try to prove the decades of expensive neglect are my fault.

I had my friend with me who is also a student at the college and this doctor recommended a medical examination to be sure. Pls note he is also  a surgeon so it is within his professional scope to conduct this examination.  during the exam, he asked my friend to quickly leave the room to retrieve a stethoscope from the nurses room as he didn't have one on hand. when my friend  left he locked the door of the examination room on us and took that moment to slip his hands  underneath my bra and started to feel my breasts. I got scared and asked him what he was doing and he  said why are you so upset this is a medical exam. When my friend returned without a stethoscope because the nurses room was locked, the doctor left the room to go get one from another place and i took this moment to leave. I informed my friend of the ordeal that happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

After much thought and deliberation when I came to report the incident our medical college had covid shut downs. furthermore there is a huge power imbalance between this doctor and myself. I work with him on many projects, he writes our exams ++++  and I was concerned of retaliation. And its true because when I eventually did report the incident he did kick me off of several projects I was a part of (even though he has no authority to do so).  

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest mistake was leaving this matter to be dealt with internally with the college and hospital as they have no desire for a scandal involving the SA of a student at the hands of a professor. When I tried to get a police report some months after it, it needed to be made from the police station within the hospital itself and i spent nearly 30 days trying to get one. 

Anyway the matter is now with the prosecution which is slightly better. I don't have a lawyer as I cant afford one so I am doing this on my own. I need some advice on how to explain to the prosecution why there was continued communication between me and the attacker on social groups such as whatsapp. I tried to explain that there is work that needed to be done but they don't seem to like that response. there is a power imbalance between me and my attacker that involved professional work, educational, and financial aspects...and I felt way too vulnerable to take an immediate action against him. Instead, after my attack which left me traumatic, i maintained a neutral or friendly face in front of him and my colleagues that we work with until I obtained my medical degree a few months after my attack. Once I got my degree and wasn't worried about any internal interference to keep me quiet I exposed the entire situation the first day I started work at the hospital as a junior doc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have a strong case at the moment, since my attacker was called in for investigation and he literally admitted that he examined me and asked my chaperone to leave the room for a moment which gave major red flags to the prosecutor. additionally he lied about the nature of the medical exam itself and said it was a different exam totally and not an abdominal examination. I just need some advice and your thoughts on my case ( i have a lot of anxiety and trauma from this whole situation, reporting it was extremely challenging).

They have full bedrooms at my house and love coming to stay with me. 
I filed a CPS report against my ex last week as she has been substance abusing and now selling drugs out of her house, the same house that my children live in. I have warned her before of doing drugs around my children but nothing changed so I finally went to CPS. CPS called my ex to set up an appointment at her home to speak with the kids over some allegations against her and went to speak with my children 2 days later. My children told the CPS case worker that their mom does not smoke, and does not drink (this is how I know their mom is coaching them to say these things as my own children have told me their mom does in fact drink and smoke, and I have videos of her doing both right next to them). The CPS worker then came to my house to tell me how the investigation went and she was ready to close the case until she saw the video evidence that I had. Videos of her smoking marijuana around my children, with them in the car, and also videos of her now selling marijuana out of the home. The CPS worker had me send her all of the evidence and said she will see what she can do but she said since I don’t have custody there’s not much more she can do. 
So yesterday I took my video evidence to my local police department and sat down with an investigator who took in my story and my evidence and says the next thing we need to do is have the kids questioned again and see if they will say anything about the allegations against their mom. So we are currently trying to set that up, but in the meantime is there anything else I should be doing?

Also, please be kind. I'm in a bit of a meltdown.

My sister has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse. At 55 years old she has been unable to hold a job, honestly has never even applied, and lives in my widowed mother's modest 2 bedroom. There are a number of exceptional details that would add context, but probably not tilt the legal question, but for reference:

* My mother made a number of non-trivial mistakes when we were growing up and my sister suffered the most
* My sister's drinking and drug use resulted in the death of her partner of 20 years
* My mother feels responsible for many of my sisters issues 
* My sister and mother have grown close over the last 10 years, as my sisters circumstances have continued to erode (homelessness, jail, prostitution)

Given that my sister can't/wont work, my mother has had to go back to work, at 80 years old and in documentable poor health in order to support her. This was done, according to my mom, in full enthusiasm, because my sister has been busy making repairs and taking care of the home. Fine. They live in California, I live on the east coast, so in spite of my misgivings, I've managed my anxieties largely at a distance.

Recently it has come to light that instead of taking care of the house, my sister has destroyed it. They are currently living in a motel because in paranoid fits, my sister stripped the drywall out to reveal the proof that they are being hacked by Russians, or neighbors, or, sometimes MS13. Something happened to the water heater, no idea what, but it had been allowed to dump into two rooms which no longer have floors, and have massive mold issues, leaving them in the house without hot water for dishes, clothes, showers, etcetera for over a month. I find this info out piecemeal, after pushing and cajoling because my mother is very protective of my sister and doesnt want me to think ill of her.

Surprisingly, that wasn't what finally forced them from the home, that was the rodents that had taken residence in their house, finally drawing complaints from the neighbors. Mice, but also told to me by my mother in an ""oh isnt this funny"" voice: a full family of possums lived in the house.

My mother has forbidden me from coming out to help. She insists that everything is great. She wont take my money. She wont allow me to buy her a cell, because of the hackers of course...but she is fully of sound mind, aside from the willingness to go along with my sisters delusions.

I am trying to get a restraining order against my abusive spouse, and what I was hoping for was that when I file for divorce, they won't be able to get custody for my child that I share with them. However, to get a permanent order of protection, there are some weird rules about it being multi-state. Either there has to have been an event of abuse in the state where I am getting the order, in Virginia, or they have to be served the temporary order in my state (or the abuser has to have a significant attachment to my state). I tried to get them to meet me here and have a police officer serve the papers, but that has proven unsuccessful.

So, here are my questions, can that rule about ""an event of abuse"" be over the phone? My abuser will emotionally and mentally abuse me, but they weren't in my state while that happened, so does ""abuse"" mean physical abuse or can it refer to other forms as well? It being a somewhat undefined word, at least from what I have heard, gives me strong doubts that they will accept it. 

Ideally, the order of protection does go through, but I am currently safe, but if it falls through, how will they handle custody in the divorce? There is overwhelming evidence that my spouse is harmful to me, but I have been to family court in the past and they seem to think that even though my spouse is harmful to me, they can still have a relationship with the child. I see every day the negative effects this person has had on my children, they emulate the violence and negativity. I know there's no way to fully know, but will a judge see that the harm to me is enough to keep the custody with myself, or will I need to bring up the behavioral changes this person has had on my kids? Will a judge see my spouse's bad effects on them as my own bad parenting?

# Apparently Mennonites do whatever they want here

I have the unfortunate experience of having a Mennonite family building a home next to my home.

They  all drive new vehicles with Ohio license plates. Pull around  construction trailers with no lights or license plates.  They don't tie  down any equipment on the trailers including large back hoes.

They  have received several tickets for the trailers without plates from the  police and they just ignore it and continue using them.

My village issued them a building permit when they have no insurance.

They  have no respect for anyone else's property including mine.They've  smashed several mailboxes including mine using our driveways to turn  around when they have no reason to.

They  hired a contractor to extend sewer lines through my property  digging  up my front yard and driveway and still have not repaired the damage a  month later.

The village is so sick of them they banned them from the village offices.

Apparently the rest of  us have to follow rules and laws but they can do whatever they want.

I guess I will start when my husband left me. 
It was about 15  years ago, 2 months after our last child was born. He took all of my money, my car, my coat and left me and our three children in an apartment with nothing and way to make any money in the middle of January. 
I was devastated, but I had no time to focus on anything but working to support my children. 

It's been over a decade now, and all of my children are grown up and we are no longer in abject poverty.
He abused me and my children greatly in the weeks leading up to his abandonment, to the point of permanent injury and  had been cheating for a long time when we were together, but recently I've found out he's married with kids and has been for the past 15 years. We never got divorced. He married her 1 month after he left us. 

The way I found this out is my son has been getting all of this debt and strange bills and mail for a year. We thought someone hacked him, but I've found out that he's been using my sons identity for a while lot of things. My son is his father's junior and so has the same name. He is married in my son's name.

I haven't gotten any child support from him and his debt is in the hundred thousands. I have both of our marriage certificates and the police reports on him. This is unacceptable, but I don't know what to do about it! 
I don't know if I can pay for lawyers fees to sue him for divorce or if I should just go to the police. 
I think the list of illegal things is: 
Bigamy
Identity theft
Fraud

I cut ties with them to various valid reasons. One of them, 15, has gotten expelled from my school for what i’ve heard, and could be wrong, mental health issues that put others in danger.

The 17 one lives on the other side of the country. But we used to hangout in video games and she used to go to my school as well. She was a bully here from what i’ve heard.

Now, i’ve switched through various accounts on social media these past few months. My stalkers have reported my videos and photos (none were bad but moderation usually took them down anyways) and they have also made up lies with huge creators and those creators posted me and insulted me, got their fans to harrass me as well. i’m talking accounts with 30k-70k. they are obsessed with “exposing” me for anything and everything. 

15 recently vandalized my foster home. she wrote slurs on the house and trashed the yard. i know it’s her because she’s the only person i’ve shown where i live at this foster house and she’s just a few doors down. 

i’m located in maine and i tried to do some research about how to fix this but to my knowledge i cannot get a restraining order against any of them and i’m not sure of any solutions. it’s not fair i have to delete my accounts every so often.

i watched these people harass little kids online, and do the same to strangers but never to the extent as me. i think they only do it to me this much because i was once a friend. i’m only at my last straw because i just went through a horrible situation online with a big creator and found that my stalker caused it all. i have since made things clear with the creator and they believed me but i can’t do this anymore. i can’t block everyone i suspect is a fake account. i’ve tried going private but sometimes the account is already following me. which leads me to making new accounts etc. i shouldn’t have to private my accounts. i know if there is no other solution i will continue staying private or just offline in general.

i’ve also tried confronting them about it and they don’t reply or go on a tangent about some past and very minor drama. i’ve reached out to their parents and never got a response. i’ve reached out to friends of theirs and they either ignore it or don’t want to be involved. help?",legaladvice,i’m being stalked for no reason and can’t do anything about it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6ongr/im_being_stalked_for_no_reason_and_cant_do/

The TL;DR: Can Canadians and Americans own and use lawn darts? For other countries, what restrictions do they have regarding their sale and usage?

For those unfamiliar with these toys, back in the early 80s these were all the rage for parties and outdoor fun during the summer. They were also known by the brand name Jarts. Their typical design were a plastic tri-fin with a plastic rod sticking out the back end, and a solid blunted metal tip on the front (some versions used weighted plastic tips).

The goal was to throw these into plastic loops, and you determine the winner based on how close you get. These were thrown by a underhand lob while holding it by the plastic rod sticking out the back.

Understandably, these metal rods were extremely dangerous if someone were in the line of fire, and they led to thousands of cases of permanent brain injury, loss of an eye, and even three deaths. This led to the requirement of warning labels limiting them to adult play, and an eventual outright ban of their sale in the US and Canada in the late 1980s, a law which still stands.

As it currently stands, in the US and Canada, it is illegal to sell them, not only commercially, but even in garage sales. And in Canada at least you're not even allowed to *lend* them. In recent years a company in the UK was caught importing them and led to a recall which essentially recommended their destruction.

However, I haven't found anything that has specifically fit anything about *ownership* being illegal. From the sounds of it, as long as I am their final owner, I can legally keep them until the day I die, after which they have to be destroyed.

However, just to be on the safe side, I want to ask the following question: Are we allowed to use these if we still own them?

Although I am asking as a Canadian, I would like anyone to respond as I would like this post to be searchable by anyone wanting to ask the same question. I'm also aware that the European Union currently allows the production and sale of lawn darts, so knowing the nuances of ownership and self from different countries would also be useful for other people.

I'm also well aware that these lawn darts can be extremely dangerous and the owner is liable if anyone gets hurt with them. I personally believe that anyone who owns them should keep them locked away until they're used, and to treat any game of lawn darts like how you would treat a gun range.

I'm willing to edit this post to reference responses from each individual country for easy answer finding.

Hi, i don't know if what i am writing about fits here, but if anybody could help us we would be forever greatful.

My girlfriend is not a cam model, just an average university student. Although her icloud got hacked a year/half a year ago. (We didn't know about it till now).  
And we just found out a couple of weeks ago that some of her private pictures/videos were posted on rare-videos.net , [private-shows.net](https://private-shows.net/), [nudespree.com](https://nudespree.com/) and [anon-v.com](https://anon-v.com/)  and a couple of other sites with her full name withouth her knowledge and consent.

Right after we encountered these videos we contacted local authorities and google as well, but unfortuntely Canadian law enforcement proves to be ineffective after weeks of waiting regarding the investigation. The pretty much told us that there is nothing they can do and gave us a contact number for a psychology/trauma personal who could help her accept the situation.  


  
Apparently some of her pictures/ videos were posted as far back a year ago and the latest ones were from 6 months ago. We think that she only got hacked once though.

She is terrified, humuliated, scared and ashamed and has panic moments, as well as I am.  
Her future is at stake and we are running out of options of what to do and how to force these sites to take the videos down as well as google to remove the pictures from their search engine. (Although they said that they will, we are still waiting on them to do so and wondering if we could fasten up the process).

Back in early July I was in contact with a fella from FB Marketplace about a used, large format printer he was selling. It was a 63” wide HP Latex 360 printer.

I messaged the guy and asked him why he’s selling it and why for so cheap (these printers retail for upwards of $17,000).

He sort of ignored the second question, but I did a little investigative work about his business, and from what I was reading on his website, he just basically sells used large format printers. I thought this was great. His office was only an hour away, so I figured I could even go pick the thing up if need be.  Everything checked out in my book.

In the beginning, he was very attentive to phone calls and texts. Answered all of my questions promptly and satisfactorily.

After thinking about it, I decided to buy the printer.  He sent me an invoice, and I mailed a check off to the address on the invoice.

He cashed the check on July 21st. We are now going on just about a month of him having my money.

From July 21st until mid August, he completely ignored my calls and texts. I didn’t hear a thing from him.  I finally went to the police department to file a report, because it sure seemed like the guy was scamming me now.

It took me getting the police involved for him to answer my texts.

On the phone, (he answered the call from the PD) the officer told him that his options were basically give me a date of when I would receive the printer; or give me my money back. He said he couldn’t give a date, so the officer told him that he needs to call me and arrange sending me a refund.  This was A-OK with me.

He also told the officer that, he doesn’t warehouse these printers, they actually come directly from print shops that are selling them all throughout the country- yet another thing he didn’t disclose to me.  He didn’t even have a printer to send to me yet.

(How can you sell me something that you don’t even own?)

At this point, I was done. I didn’t even want the printer anymore, I just wanted my money back and I would go buy another one elsewhere.

Well, the guy texts me and lets me know that the printer is now ready for pickup and he’s waiting on the freight company to come get it.  That was 2 weeks ago.  In a nutshell, I told him to send me my money back because he’s lied to me constantly and I don’t even want the printer anymore.

Fast forward to late last week. I messaged him, he again told me that he is simply waiting on the freight company, to come pick it up.  (Again I said I want my money back don’t even bother shipping the thing)

At this point he promised me that if the printer was not picked up by this Wednesday (August 11) that I would get my money back. August 11 came and went, and I still hadn’t had tracking info on this printer.

He just kept extending the date and extending the date. Wednesday turned into Thursday, Thursday turned into Friday, Friday turned into Monday, any guesses on what Monday turned into? Tuesday.

I advised the guy that if this printer shows up, I will NOT be accepting it so I suggest he call the freight company and cancel it entirely. His answer was “if you don’t accept it, that’s on you.” Basically, I’d be out a printer and $4500 if I don’t take it.

On Tuesday (yesterday), I had seriously had enough.  This guy broke my trust and basically stole $4500 from me.  I called the freight company, and to my (not) surprise, he had only scheduled it last Thursday (aug 12)!  He told me it’s been scheduled for weeks!!  I told the freight company to not even bother picking it up, because if it shows up I am not accepting it.  They obliged and I can only assume they didn’t pick it up.  Another thing- the guy told me the printer was coming from Georgia, well, nope, it’s coming from Oregon, just another lie.



What can I really do from a legal standpoint?  I think I did the right thing by having the freight company not even pick the thing up, I mean it was just going to be a waste of my time and theirs if I had them bring it 3100 miles from Oregon to NY, and then another 3100 back.

Will I just have to bring the guy to small claims court if he doesn’t return my money?",legaladvice,"[US-NY] I bought a printer for $4500, promises were broken, I was lied to more times than I can count, I’m told I’m basically out the money and the printer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6n4kk/usny_i_bought_a_printer_for_4500_promises_were/

Side note: This occurred in Minnesota.

On Saturday 8/14 a driver in a stolen vehicle was speeding along the road, and had gone into the shoulder to avoid hitting people. They lost control, spun out, hit a sign, which caused them to swerve into the lane I was in and almost caused me to T-bone them. They then, while only about of foot of space between my front bumper and their passenger side of their car, open their doors to run away from the cops on foot after crashing their stolen vehicle into the ditch. The cops come not 10 seconds later armed with assault rifles and chase them down. (No, no shots had to be fired. I do believe they were tased, then apprehended. According to the cop I had talked to, they are in custody.)

Thing is, I was almost injured myself in this incident and me having to suddenly slam my brakes caused mild whiplash. I want to pursue my own case and see if I have a leg to stand on. I have a dashcam which caught everything. It’s also a wide angle lens, so while it appears to be not super close, it was definitely just about a foot in front of me. I have a copy of this video on hand should anyone want to see it.

Should I go forward and press charges? And what exactly should those charges be? I know reckless endangerment is one of them, but I have been a nervous wreck since the incident.

I am in the midst of a very complicated eviction case down here in Texas.  We were hit hard, very hard, by the pandemic (like so many others).  We became delinquent in our rent, sending our landlord signed declarations claiming us as “covered persons” under the CDC Eviction Moratorium.  Our landlord filed suit anyway, and the JP ruled in our favor.  A few weeks later, we received a letter in the mail from the Texas Eviction Diversion Program, and our landlord and We both applied.  After a few weeks, our landlord must have felt like it was taking too long, because the JP allowed her to file suit for non-payment of rent again.  This time, the Judge ruled in the landlord’s favor, even though we had proof that our rental assistance application was still pending.  We appealed, and were forced to pay a full months rent into the Justice Court Registry when we did not have it.  A date was set for a de novo hearing at the County Court, but mere days before the hearing date, our application for rental assistance was approved.  Our landlords were paid more than the amount that we owed them, and when we arrived to court a few days later, we were told that the hearing had been reset due to a scheduling conflict.  The judge’s secretary claimed that they had sent notice by mail, but we did not receive it until later that day.  A reset date was given a week later, but a few days went by and I received an email stating that the judge had granted a continuance requested by the landlord’s attorney.  It simply said that “the continuance was granted until further notice”.  That was about a month and a half ago, and we have heard nothing.  My question is, this is blatantly illegal, right?  I thought a stay in eviction proceedings had to be agreed upon by both parties?  We have literally been living out of boxes since November  of last year.  And here’s the kicker...our HVAC system went out on October 8th of 2020.   The landlord refused to repair it because we owed past-due rent.  We had already sent her the signed CDC declaration, yet we endured the coldest winter in recorded history with no heat at all.

When I entered the gym to meet with the trainer, I explicitly stated I was interested in about 6 weeks of sessions 3 times a week.

While reading the contract where I was signing, albeit not closely, I saw something about canceling requiring 30 days notice. No problem, I provide that in writing 2 weeks in. When I asked if that's what I needed to do, it felt brushed off by the trainer. On gut instinct, I read my contract more closely this evening. 

Member's Right To Cancel:
As a personal training client of ""fitness club"" of ""city,"" I fully understand the Cancellation
Policies which state that I cannot cancel my personal training agreement unless I become
permanently disabled (doctor's note required) or I move more than ten miles away from my current
address and will no longer be using the ""fitness city"" club, which requires a 30 day written notice and proof of new address.

Where this gets sticky is the contract term says 66 units (three 1 hour sessions per week billed every 2 weeks for 5 months). 

In Colorado, you have the right to cancel a health club contract within 3 business days of signing per CO Rev Stat § 6-1-704. While this contract is for the personal trainer aspect, not the membership at the health club, does the same statute apply here or did I just sign up to fork over way more money than I said I wanted to?

I plan to clarify this tomorrow morning with the club, but if I do not get clear, concise answers or am told I signed it and I'm paying it, what should I do? We're talking thousands of dollars and at no point did the personal trainer make mention of a minimum amount of sessions. I signed digitally, and that was set up to where I didn't see the total units at the top. 

It feels incredibly deceptive, but I set myself up for it by not pumping the brakes when a salesman brushed a question off. I appreciate your help.

Before I go into detail, please keep in mind that I do plan to consult with a lawyer and I know speeding is bad!

I was given a citation/court summons for speeding while driving home from my grandma's house last weekend. I was allegedly going 67MPH in a 35. 

For context: 

* I'm located in FL, so any speeding ticket for 30MPH or more above the speed limit requires a court appearance. 
* The cop who pulled me over was driving on the same road as me, but coming from the opposite direction. 
* This is my first time offense for speeding (not sure if this matters). 

Factors I am curious about:

1. I'm certain that the area I was pulled over in was either 40MPH or 45MPH speed limit, not 35 like the ticket states. If the ticket stated the correct speed limit I wouldn't have had to appear in court, I would've only had to pay a fine (just my luck).
2. The speed measurement device on the ticket states, ""VISUAL 46 (ASO16555)."" Does this mean that the 67MPH I was alleged to have been going was determined by the cop's discretion alone, rather than the use of a radar or laser device? Hard to imagine how he could've clocked me while he was also driving. Also, I'm very skeptical that I was even going this fast.

I'm just wondering what y'all think this might mean for my case. Any thoughts are appreciated and thank you in advance!",legaladvice,Discrepancies in speeding ticket,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6legc/discrepancies_in_speeding_ticket/

I'm posting on behalf of my wife, who is a nurse practitioner in Virginia, as she is not a Redditor. Thank you all in advance for your time.

She began her employment with a practice in 2019. And in her original employment contract, it states that the practice requires a 90 day notice period before resigning (\*this is important). As you all know, COVID struck in early-mid 2020. The practice was barely getting any patients, since most people wanted to stay as far away as possible from sick people. Ironic, I know. 

Unfortunately, during this time of uncertainty, some practices (including my wife's place of employment), shifted the risk onto its employees by converting them from salaried employees to hourly ones. At times, she was only getting 10 hours a week, and there was no guarantee that she would even receive 10 hours -- it was all based on the number of patients on the schedule. In order to do this legally, the practice modified my wife's original employment contract to say that going forward, she would be an hourly employee. Fearing she would lose her job if she did not sign this amended contract, my wife signed it. 

Towards the end of 2020, the number of patients were returning back to normal. Therefore, my wife asked the doctor (we'll call him Doctor A) running the practice if she could be converted back to a full-time employee. The doctor kept putting it off. To make matters worse, despite business returning back to normal, the doctor asked my wife to sign a second modification to the contract, essentially renewing the clause that made her into an hourly employee. I'm not sure if it was on purpose, but the doctor asked my wife to sign the document in-between seeing her patients, which gave her no time to review the contract. My wife is trusting to a fault, and signed the second modification to the contract without fully understanding what it said. (Trust me, I've asked her to please read carefully before signing anything from now on.)

Luckily, last week, my wife was offered a job from a doctor (we'll call him Doctor B) she interned with in the past. It was for a full-time position, and she was ecstatic, as Doctor B had been a great boss to her in the past. Unfortunately, the new practice needs her to start in 30 days, and would not budge. Given my wife has asked to be converted back to full-time for almost a year now without luck, she figured Doctor A would understand her 30 days notice. So she submitted a resignation letter with a notice which read that her last day would be in 30 days. 

In short, Doctor A threw a fit as soon as he received the resignation letter. He threated to sue my wife for breaking the contract. He apparently has a history of doing this, and there hasn't been a single provider who left amicably. He's used intimidation tactics, saying he's going to pursue litigation and keeps repeating the phrase ""things might get messy"". It's worked in the past, since no provider sought legal counsel, and instead worked the entire 90 days, very unhappily. 

My wife is an absolute saint. I fully get why she works in her field -- her life revolves around her patients, and she even volunteers at homeless shelters on the weekends. But at the same time, I get why Doctor A wants to keep her for 90 days, since it's hard to find employees right now. 

We are unsure what to do at the moment since neither of us have been in this position (I'm an engineer by profession). It's heartbreaking to see her crying in her car when she comes home, and I feel helpless. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",legaladvice,Employer threatening to sue me for not fulfilling 90 day resignation notice period.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6l1aa/employer_threatening_to_sue_me_for_not_fulfilling/

For whatever reason, roommate A decided to move out at the beginning of April, leaving roommate B and I to deal with the apt.

So now he’s gone and roommate B and I are wondering what’s gonna happen with that empty room, are they gonna make us pay more, are they gonna fill in the room, what’s gonna happen. So we ask and get little to no reply about the situation. We continue to pay what we owe for our rooms and our landlord gives no mention of the charges for the next few months. He even brings in the super to clean the room and tells us he plans on showing it, so we believe that management would handle filling in the new room. Now comes around early July. I inform my landlord that I plan on moving out and I’d like to know A) how to get my security deposit back B) what’s the deal with the charges and will we be liable for them. My landlord instead poses his own question which is “is roommate B moving aswell”. Which to I reply I don’t know and can you please answer my other questions in my last email. To no response. Now it is almost 3 weeks into August, I am fully moved into my new apartment and I ask about my security deposit again. Now my landlord decides to tell me that they are reviewing it with their legal team since their was a balance left over after I moved. 

Now, I fully understand that since the three of us were on the lease we were all responsible for paying rent. However, I would say that the complete lack of organization and utter mishandling of the situation calls for leniency of some sort. I mean they pursued zero action until the end of the lease when the charge had increased to nearly $4k. Gave us nothing and told us nothing and then decides to drop this on us. Now I know given the fact that there is a signed legal document that doesn’t exactly play out in my favor but I was wondering if there’s anything I can do?

They went back on their word after I enrolled and I had to take out a loan to cover a few thousand (about 4k). They continued to do this every year: provide the document stating no out of pocket costs for the year, clear my account at the beginning of each semester then a random amount of a couple thousand (4-5k) shows up on my account mid semester and I'm forced to cover it out of pocket or with a loan.

They did so again during the pandemic with a much larger amount (over 10k). Most of that was my housing allowance. Many students chose to go home or away from campus when the pandemic came. I went away too, except I did not have the option of going back home so I had to sustain myself. The school's excuse for taking away the aid was that a student who was not staying on campus was staying with their parents and therefore did not incur any rent/meal expenses, so they did not see the need to keep the housing allowance as part of their aid package. This was not the case for me, as I still had these costs but could not cover them due to pandemic job loss and being a full time student.

I found out about it a few weeks toward the end of the semester, tried to fight it with the finance office but they either did not get back to me or kept going around in circles over procedure and next steps. When the semester ended, they automatically signed me up for a loan with a third party collections agency for the amount, then the agency sent me notice that I have 30 days to pay the full amount or they will take action. My questions are:

1. Is it legal for them to go back on their word and not offer the financial aid amount they list as part of enrollment package and as part of the yearly aid package? I have had to pay an unexpected 4-5k out of pocket every year. I can barely afford it and if I had known about it, I wouldn't have attended the school. I have to work 60+ hrs a week in addition to being a full time student just to afford it. They are infamous for overpromising especially to international students then leaving them stranded with add on tuition bills once they are enrolled.
2. Is it legal for them to sign me up for a loan without my knowledge or written consent? They kept encouraging me to sign up for a loan instead of fighting for the aid amount I was initially promised. I did not do that. However, the letter I received from the collections agency states there is a loan in the same amount that is in my name.
3. I have tried to reach out to the school's finance office over the summer and received only one email to say that my bill is no longer valid and that I should direct all inquiries to the collections agency. I cannot afford to pay this amount at all and I want to keep fighting for financial aid. What are the best next steps to take for this?

Note: This is not a merit scholarship or a scholarship dependent on anything else on my side. It is grant money that is part of a financial aid package.

What do I do here?

My parents have been married for 24 years. My mom caught him cheating after 3 years of marriage and to which she said it was a mistake and that he'd never repeat again. By that time, my mum had two little girls(me and my sister) so for our sake she decided to stay in the marriage with him and forgave. Now, ever since I can remember, the behavior of my father has always been neglectful towards us. He yells at us all for small mistakes and mum has always been the only one to support us in everything. 

Fast forward to 2021, when I am 22 and my sister is 21, and a brother, 10. for the past few days, my dad had been acting suspicious, so my sister decided to check his phone and we discovered some evidence of him cheating on our mom. There were sexting chats and photos of that woman but nothing in a compromisable situation. Turned out he went to meet a woman after lying to us that he was going to work and was with her whole day. We told mum and she was heartbroken. She said she had some doubts but never thought things would be this bad.

We have been encouraging her to get a divorce and she wants one too. Is this evidence enough to prove that he is committing adultery? What more evidence should we collect? Also, my father and mother both are working and purchased the home with both of their money. But the house is under the father's name. Could we get the house in any way. Also, we live in India, if that matters.

Also, since the divorce proceedings take a lot of time(years), we are slightly worried about how we should proceed with it. We are also worried he might try to use violence with us. No idea how we should move forward with it. Any advice would be very helpful.",legaladvice,Caught my father cheating on my mom.

I bought an air conditioner ($324) from Walmart 05/05/21. It stopped blowing cold air towards the end of July. I called the support number for the manufacturer (TCL) and they went through troubleshooting and came to the conclusion  that the unit was defective and advised me to return it to Walmart. 

I brought it to the Walmart closest to me, not the one where I purchased it, and they scanned the receipt and the serial number on the unit and told me they didn't match.  I asked how this is possible, and they said the Walmart where I bought it must have re-boxed it for whatever reason. They said to take it back to the store where I bought it and they would have to fix it. I went to the original store and they said they didn't re-box it and to call TCL again because they must have screwed it up.

I called TCL the next day and they told me its impossible for them to mismatch serial numbers and barcodes because both have to be scanned together. Without me even mentioning re-boxing, the customer rep suggested that Walmart re-boxed it. They advised me to call the Walmart corporate office and have them reach out to the store manager. The store manager called today, she was made aware of the serial numbers not matching, and asked me to bring the AC in and we could work this out. I brought it in and she examined it and proclaimed ""the serial numbers don't match."" She said they cannot take it back with different serial numbers. I asked why the hell she asked me to load it in my car and drive it in, and she said because she wanted to see if there was another sticker that I didn't see. She said that I should call TCL because its their fault. 

I don't have the original box anymore, just the receipt and air conditioner. Should I take the loss or have a lawyer write a letter on my behalf?

This is Tacoma, Wa.  I have tried contacting the management company, and entered the below in the intake form for the appropriate city division.  and Tomorrow I will attempt to contact [CLEAR](https://nwjustice.org/clear-hotline).  I'll draft a letter fulfilling the requirement in [RCW 59.18.150](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.150) § 8, and attempt to mail it registered on Thursday.

Besides normal cleaning for inspection, is there anything else I should do?

Below is text sent to Tacoma LTP:

On the evening of 2021-08-16, a notice was posted on my door stating, in part: ""On August 18th through Saturday August 21st, 2021, we will have a maintenance crew coming through to inspection (SIC) each unit for repairs  before our REAC inspection on August 31st, 2021.""

At about 1400 2021-08-17, I went to the office and found it closed.  Seeing a maintenance worker about to enter, I asked if he could check if they planned to open today.  After poking his head in, he informed me they were in a meeting, and it would be 5 to 10 minutes.

After waiting about 10 minutes,  I asked another maintenance man if he could get a chair from the office for me to use while I wait.  I have a visually obvious disability, and have trouble standing for long periods.

Instead, a lady came out and asked me what I needed.  I attempted to say the notice given was improper in at least two aspects.  She told me it didn't matter, the water was already off, and work was being done.  This was a separate matter, for which I did receive notice.  

When I said the notice of entry was wrong and was asked to elaborate, I stated that 2 days' written notice must be given, and list times.  She said notice was given, I again said it was not proper.  She then said to come back in an hour, she was going to lunch.  I started to ask, ""Isn't lunch at..."" while looking for a missing notice that listed office hours, including when they were closed for lunch.  She told me that she ""takes lunch when she wants"", and re-entered the office.

At this point, I said ""Well."" and started to turn towards elevators to leave.  I heard her say, from within the office ""Well, indeed.  I'm not opening if he's still out there.""

At this point, a different lady exited and asked me what was the matter.  I again attempted to tell her the notice was wrong.  When asked I said that the notice was for less than the required time, and no time period was given.  She said times were listed.  I asked her to show me on the paper where it listed times.  She pointed to the dates.  ""I said ""the law requires a time or range of times.  Or did they intend to start inspections Wednesday evening?""

She told me inspection would be from ""nine to five"".  I pointed out that that was less than 48 hours' notice.  She then told me it didn't matter because they were a year overdue for their inspection, and the city was ""making them do it""

I said the notice was improper, and she told me she was giving me a verbal notice.  I told her that didn't matter, the law requires written notice.  She again told me she was giving verbal notice, and asked me if there was anything else.  

I told her that I have a video conference with my therapist Wednesdays between 15 and 16 o'clock, and needed to schedule the inspection to not come during that time, as I needed audio and visual privacy.  She told me that because they have given notice, it could not be rescheduled.  I attempted to point out that asking for them not to come for one hour did not seem unreasonable to me, nor did I think a court would think so.  She said it was unreasonable because they had given notice, and said I could use the ""Community center"".  I note that this is a glass-walled public room, that would not allow audio and visual privacy.  It is also the local office for &lt;redacted&gt;, a social services company &lt;redacted&gt; subcontracts with for services.

I told her that I would refuse entry during that period, and that proper notice was not given.  She again stated she had given me verbal notice, and I parried with the fact it was not according to state law.  A security guard exited the office, and told me to ""calm down"".  I stated I was calm, and told the lady that without proper notice, they could not enter.  The guard then told me I had been given written notice.

At this point, I returned to my apartment, and tried to call &lt;redacted&gt;, but ultimately got an answering machine.  I then gathered links for [the Tacoma Landlord-Tenant Program] office, state, and local laws.  While doing this, about an hour after returning to my apartment, two maintenance workers attempted to enter my apartment.  When I asked what they were there for, they told me an inspection was scheduled.  As I had only recently returned from making a complaint, I believe this is landlord harassment.

I note that it is now 2021-08-17 20:07, and having just checked, I still have not received proper notice.

He works in an assembly line, and his coworker (I'll call him CW) is constantly calling off, using FMLA as an excuse. CW got a doctor's note for his shoulder, and takes 3 days off every week of summer. During this time, CW runs a lawn care business, while keeping his other job for the insurance.

This makes my boyfriend need to work extra to cover CW. This is a HUGE strain to him, and causes him to work 60 hours a week sometimes. With summer coming to a close, CW's not going to be able to use FMLA anymore this year, since his 15 weeks is almost up. 

I know this is going to happen again next year, though. Is there anything we can do to prove he's ineligible for FMLA by providing proof of his second business? Or is he able to do this. My boyfriend says there isnt anything we can do, but I want to double check just to be sure.

When I told him I didn't want to talk to him any longer, he threatened me to leak my nude photos (without my face in it), and contact my boss, my parents, and all my social media friends.

FBoy Island is a reality show. It is a dating competition show. At the end, three women had the opportunity to choose a self-proclaimed ""FBoy"" or ""Nice Guy"". The hostess of the show then explained the rules as follows: if the woman chose the nice guy, they would split $100,000 and start dating. If the woman chose the FBoy, said FBoy would have the choice of splitting the money and starting a relationship with the woman, or keeping the entire 100k and not dating the woman. They would have to publicly make their decision after the woman chose them.

One woman chose an FBoy, who then took the option of keeping all the money and dumping the woman.

Then, the hostess of the show said NO, he wasnt going to get the money. Instead, all 100k would be donated to a charity of the woman's choice. So it was a trick of some kind. The FBoy ended up looking like a dick and didnt get any money. 

Let's make some assumptions. Let's assume this was not staged. Let's also assume that the FBoy did not sign something to the effect of ""HBO can do whatever it wants with the prize money"" (even though he probably did). Let's also assume they truly didn't give him the 100k off screen.

This is actually a video I ran across on TikTok (yeah I know, TikTok, but keep an open mind here).  I’ll link the video but here is a quick synopsis…

It all started after a new neighbor moved in. Their dog tried to get through their fence onto TikToker’s (TT) property. Dog only got it’s foot through the fence when TT dog ran up and bit their dog.

TT offered to split vet bill, neighbor presented “estimate” for $2600, TT agreed to pay half $1300, and neighbor said No, you pay it all… then went to court… tried to then sue for $10k (emotional stress, yada yada). They list case and got $0… also come to find out the vet bill was actually $1800 so they lied there too.

Now with a grudge to hold since they didn’t win, neighbor put up video cameras on their property pointing only at TTs house. Pointed into living room, pointing into daughters bed room… then 2 more went up, pointing at outdoor kids play set and the pool…

Hell neighbor gets survey done, finds out they have 5 inches of property on the other side of the fence, so technically in TT’s yard. The fence was there when both parties moved it but was erected by former owner of hell neighbors house.

Hell neighbor puts wooden stakes and no trespassing signs on opposite side of fence, on TTs “property” though technically not (it’s in the 5 inches that belong to hell neighbor).

Cops called multiple times by hell neighbor on TT for stupid shit.

TT has to mow their lawn, so they technically have to mow the 5 inches that is on their side of fence but is owned by hell neighbor. If they do not maintain it, they city will cite and fine them. If they do mow it, neighbor calls cops for trespassing.

That’s the gist of it.

Anyway, my significant other's mother died in 2019 in a nursing home. My SO's sister sued the nursing home and they recently settled on an amount. The case was the nursing home vs. SO, SO's sister, and their brother to be split 3 ways.  This is where things get tricky, last week both my SO's sister and brother died. We just got the letter yesterday to contact the attorney. Of course they told us the amount that they settled for. The attorney was informed of the situation. The attorney is to receive 1/3 of the settlement and now, because the others are deceased, my SO is to get the remaining 2/3's. However, the attorney informed us that, although they are not entitled to any of the money, there were 3 people his sister listed as next of kin and they had to be notified. He said that we could not finalize and nor see a penny of it until those 3 people sign something. It doesn't make sense to us. The 3 people are 2 nieces and 1 nephew who we have not seen in years. One is a minor aged 15. One is 19 (honestly her mind isn't stable and she might as well be a minor) and the other is in his 30's and both are distant from the family. We aren't wanting to be greedy and keep all of the money. Its a handsome amount and we don't care to give maybe $10,000 a piece to each of them. Is it possible to do that quickly and keep it out of court? Also, it kinda upset us that they have to sign it before we can see any of it if they aren't receiving any of it. There are other nieces, nephews, and children (like my SO's 3 sons, 1 is a minor aged 16 and could use money for college) who were not listed. What's that about? Money makes people crazy. The 19 year old treated us like crap when we were struggling and having to live with family, but we're still willing to give her an equal part because that's what their aunt would've wanted. Is it a possibility that she could want to cause us trouble and not sign the document?

I am going to try my best but I am all over the place and truly in a state of shock. I was terminated today from my job for various reasons? I requested an ADA reasonable accommodation on 7/20/21 I had made 4 follow up attempts to the director of HR regarding my request. 2 via email and 2 voicemails, I spoke to my supervisor twice and then finally called the county I worked for managers office to follow up. Nothing, now today exactly 4 weeks from my request I am terminated.

Here’s why I was terminated. Please keep in mind I had just had a squeaky clean 6-month review in April. This was written in the letter they gave me but prior to had  never relayed to me as an employee verbally or written. 

1. I was insubordinate for refusing a required shift with a coworker I had an issue with. This is not true and I have documentation (emails to and from boss) which describe the situation. It wasn’t a required shift either it was an extra weekend shift and once I explained I couldn’t work with this person I WAS TOLD by my supervisor I couldn’t work the shift. Also this was in May. 

2. Late last month I had checked my own personal health record to check the status of my COVID test. Which they said violated their policy. I checked the my records because I was under quarantine and needed to know if I could return to work (I was tested over the weekend) 

3. The last piece was how I didn’t ask coworkers if they needed help with work? Idk what that means since my work is pre assigned.

I am so furious and confused because I truly believe this was in retaliation for my ADA request (which I never received ANY word about) ANY help would be so appreciated. I said almost nothing during the termination, I didn’t not sign the paper they gave me.

We live in Minnesota. Our HVAC wasn't cooling at the beginning of June. We called the company that originally installed the unit and they sent a guy out. He did some cleaning inside the unit, added some freon, and replaced a leaking hose. He was there for 2 hours.

When he left there was a very loud humming noise coming from the unit. So loud that it was vibrating the floor directly above the unit. We called them back and asked about it and I was told on the phone that, ""If it was something we did, we'll stand by it."" A week later they sent out someone to investigate the noise. The guy immediately diagnosed it as a bad blower motor. I asked for an explanation of what the previous technician did, and it turns out he had removed the blower motor while cleaning the unit, and put it back in. The damage to the motor looks like it could easily have been caused by something as simple as setting it down on the concrete floor too hard. Clearly the previous tech had damaged it. The guy replaces the motor, loud sound goes away.

Couple weeks later we get a bill for over $700. $200 for the original visit (which is fine) and more than $500 for the follow up visit to fix the damage they caused. It include a full retail price for the blower motor they replaced and it included 2.5 more labor hours than what was worked. (They subdivide labor hours by .25 hour intervals)

I sent them a letter and explained that it was not right for us to pay full price for a blower motor that they damage and explained that I would be happy to meet them somewhere in the middle on the blower motor. I further explained that it was not right for us to pay for any of the labor on the follow up visit as the follow up visit was due to them damaging the unit in the first visit. I also pointed out that even if I had agreed to pay for labor on the second visit, the hours listed were incorrect.

They replied by sending the same invoice with a ""discount"" of 1.5 labor hours. (for those doing the math, that's still 1 full hour of labor more than what was worked) They said that ""it's very common for blower motors to wear out over time"" and that ""you must pay full retail for this motor and you must pay for the labor"". I sent another letter reiterating my position and pointing out that they still had labor hours listed that were not worked which made it seem to me that they weren't taking my concerns seriously. Their claim about blower motors being a point of failure and a common problem is probably 100% true, but it's absolutely absurd and ridiculous to believe that a blower motor would just happen to wear out and break of it's own accord at the exact same time that it was being directly handled by someone.

From that point on they have continued to send the same bill with new late fees each time and saying things like, ""our technician is very gentle"", and ""You seem to want us to not pay our employees.""

I'm at a loss for what to do with these people. I offered to pay for roughly 75% of the motor and 100% of the costs of the original visit but none of the labor associated with the second visit. They refused to send anything back other than the same bill. I'm kinda worried about where this is going to go because my last letter was that I would ignore their bills if they weren't going to negotiate with me to reach a reasonable and fair agreement.

I've withheld all payments, including the payment for the original visit even though I have no dispute with the charges of that visit. Namely because that visit is the visit in which my unit was damage and thusly I feel it's inseparable from the dispute.

They refuse to negotiate the price despite me offering to meet them halfway on the damage they did.",legaladvice,"HVAC company damaged my unit and then charged me to repair the damage and also charged more labor hours than were worked.

This is in California 

I was Ellis Act evicted by my lifelong “friend”  with a move out date of 7/31 so that my godson could move in with his girlfriend.

For a variety of reasons I was not able to take all of my belongings or plants with me on July 31st, that day I asked for more time and she said no. The place was left messy/dirty but no damage and actually I had fixed several things so it was in better repair than when I moved in 6 years ago. 

8/1 we spoke on the phone, she had already thrown away everything in my storage space and most of my room. Luckily she hadn’t yet trashed anything in the common areas “in case their belonged to my roommate” who she had given until 8/10 to move out because he was on vacation since that is where my sisters art was. During this call I asked and offered to come back to finish cleaning and she adamantly declined. 

I am a gardener and a huge plant person, they are like pets to me. I took as many of my favorite/most valuable plants as I could on 7/31 but there was over $1000 worth of plants and pots I didn’t take. During our 8/1 call, unprompted, she asked me how to care for the plants that were still there and we spent a good 10-15 min while she went outside to look at them while I talked her through and asked several specific questions about their care. 

At this time mentioned that she would be in So.Cal (400 miles from her home/my old home)  to visit my godson because it turns out he won’t be needing the flat until September some time and i’m currently staying in so. Cal so she suggested we could get lunch. I asked her why she was adamant about me vacating 7/31 instead of letting me finish if the house was going to be empty for over a month but she wouldn’t answer me. 

I sent her a list of the most valuable and irreplaceable things I had left as I remembered everything I forgot or left and she put whatever she hadn’t thrown away in a box for me. 

Anxious to retrieve the rest of my belongings, I enlisted help to make the 6 hour 400 mile drive to get the rest of my stuff. I informed her in advance and we originally arranged a time of Tuesday 8/17 at 9:30am. I was up there by 1pm on Monday 8/16 but she wasn’t available to give me my belongings until 10pm.

I pulled up to the house at 10pm and noticed a huge mess in front of the and a few of my plant shelves (but empty) and a lot of dirt everywhere. She handed me the box of my belongings and I asked to go in the back to get my plants and she said “there are no more plants back there they are all out here”. I asked a few more times to got get my plants and pots in the back because I was unable to comprehend what she was saying. She told me a few more times there was nothing back there and that she put everything up here and “people have been taking them all
Day” before she quickly excused herself. 

My former house is in the center of a major metropolitan area 2 blocks from a super popular tourist destination full of shops and bars, it is well understood by all of us if there’s ANYTHING you don’t want anymore just put it in front of the house and it will be gone within an hour- even junk.

Besides the hysterics that I was in both 7/31 and last night, several thousands of dollars of my personal belongings as well as priceless irreplaceable things were trashed or given away without my consent and while I was literally in the process of trying to retrieve them. I am currently unemployed, most of this was nice stuff I acquired when I had a high paying stable job- I cannot afford to replace any of my belongings or plants right now let alone all of them.  In addition I spent ~$400 coming to get my stuff because even per my landlord I definitely needed a vehicle to get everything but was handed only a shoebox full of my belongings. 

Of note: I do have an interest free debt without a repayment due date that I owe to her as a friend unrelated to landlord/tenant issues. I had been working it down through pet sitting and home repairs before I moved. 

Aside from the obviously fucked up and dysfunctional social aspect that I have to work out, Is there any recourse here or did she have the right to do this?

My most toxic relationship with an abusive person went more amicably than this.

Tl;dr: i moved out 7/31 but couldn’t get everything out in time. After asking how to care for them, my landlord kept something she knew was literally priceless to me for 15 days and then gave away or trashed all of it hours before I came to retrieve them without warning and with no explanation.

2131,ta14423676,1629253658,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6i6kc/ny_noisevibration_throughout_apartment_due_to/,p6i6kc,False,False,1,1629253670,"Me and my roommate just recently moved into an apartment building that was built in 2019. During the viewing we were here for about 45 minutes and didn't hear/see any issues. There's only been one prior tenant. There's a restaurant beneath the unit. We didn't anticipate any noise issues as we viewed it at dinnertime and could barely hear anything. The apartment is gorgeous and still smells like a new build.

We move in and there's expected restaurant noise. No biggie since they close at 11. Shortly after the restaurant closes when we tried to go to sleep, we realized we have 2 commercial HVAC units above the majority of the apartment and every time they kick on there's a very loud bang. There's also a constant hum/low frequency vibration throughout the entire apartment. We didn't hear this at all during the viewing. When we signed the lease, the landlords secretary told us (in an e-mail) they they didn't know why the prior tenant moved out and said there were no complaints about noise issues.

We've now lived here for a week and the noise/vibration is unbearable. My assumption is that we don't hear the unit kick on throughout the day because it's constantly running and we hear/feel the vibration all day. Then at night when they close, I'm assuming they raise the temperature to save on electric which then causes the compressor to periodically kick on and off numerous times to maintain the minimum temp. This banging happens at least once an hour throughout the night and it's so loud the first night we went outside at 2AM because we thought a car hit the building. We have all of this documented in email communications to the LL and his staff, audio recordings, video recordings, the whole 9 yards. Things came to a head recently when the landlord called our emails to him ""pompous"" and said we were exaggerating. This prompted us to get ahold of the prior tenant. We learned he moved out for the same reasons. He provided us with emails and texts between the landlord/landlords staff that express the same issues and concerns we have almost word for word. He stated if the issues weren't fixed, he'd be out on the first day his lease expires, which he was. So we have clear evidence that the landlord and his staff lied to us this entire time. He moves out, we move in and the cycle continues.

The vibration is so bad in our bedroom that we can’t even use it. You can feel it throughout your entire body and if you rest your head against the wall, you can feel your head shaking.

They've sent out maintenance and HVAC techs who have done absolutely nothing to fix the issue aside from ""tune-ups"". The vibrations also shake the fire sprinkler pipes in the bedroom which I posted a video of on an HVAC subreddit. The folks there advised the constant vibration of the pipes can cause metal fatigue which can eventually cause the pipes to fail/crack, then in turn would cause a lot of damage to our belongings and the building itself. We've shared these concerns with the landlord and he does not care in the slightest. He laughed at us today as he walked away. I am baffled.

We're trying to figure out the best way to go about handling this. There's a binding arbitration clause in our lease that states disputes would need to be resolved outside of court? Does this fall under the Noise section specific to NY's Warrant of Habitability? We have consulted a lawyer and he seems to just be taking what the landlord says about “Investigating the issue” when they have been aware of it for over a year. We spent a lot of money moving into this place ($400 for movers, $300 non-refundable cat deposit, $2000+ on furniture) and the entire situation in itself is a major inconvenience. Are we able to sue him for monetary damages considering we have that clause in our lease? What's our best option from here? Find a better lawyer? Contact code enforcement? The prior tenant also stated he is willing to do whatever it takes to help us out.

I am residing in a low income housing in this old building with mainly immigrant families (kind of an important detail for later). 

I signed the lease and got my keys on the 7/15 /21 . When I got inside to inspect the unit, I noticed multiple flaws but mostly roaches and bugs in my kitchen sink. The faucet was dripping so I was ok that makes sense but not something a new tenant would want to see. I took pictures of everything and went back to my old apartment (due to work and my lease not ending yet, it was best for me to not fully move in yet). On 7/23/2021 I went in to clean and sanitize my apartment and on 7/24/21 I submitted a complete move in inspection (it's still being under review till this day).

I fully moved in on 7/29/2021 when my previous lease ended and still no changes have been made. I've seen roaches all over my apartment but mostly my kitchen and I have been using bug spray to kill them and keep them at bay but no luck. Not only are they on the counter tops, walls, floors, cabinets, and drawers, I also found them INSIDE both the fridge and freezer. I only had a few concealed foods in my fridge and I still had to throw it all away cause I was disgusted. I found a mouse one evening then was in my box of pantry items that I haven't put them in the kitchen for obvious reasons (all concealed with lids). Wasn't able to take a pic or vid cause it ran away but I sent out another email on 8/5/2021 to the manager and attached all new pics that I took for evidence (I always took pictures and videos whenever I can at the moment for evidence). I was immediately responded by her and she came over the next day to look at my unit, she took pics and everything and told me there was a wait-list for the exterminator but she put me on nonetheless and told me she's getting a guy to check for bed bugs since I also mentioned I was waking up with huge bug bites on my legs. 

Anyways he never came haha. There was a work order for the extermination and on 8/13/2021 they said that it was 'completed' via text message. I was at work so when I came back I literally killed another roach next to my dining table. Nothing changed and I still have documented more roaches and bugs. On 8/15/2021 I sent the manager again with more pics and a video this time and told her that I would be contacting a lawyer soon if this doesn't get fixed cause it is uninhabitable which I hoped would scare them and get them going with things. It's 8/17/20210 ) I just got back from grocery shopping cause I'm so tired and too broke to continue buying take out and delivery to feed myself. I still haven't purchased plates and silverware, and when I got home I found more bugs. I documented them again, and went to get the bug spray and it was empty. I finished it in a month. I'm tired and I genuinely believe that a lot of this happens because the majority of residents are immigrants and low income families that barely speak English (I have chatted with a few) and they are taking advantage of that so they can continue to ignore their problems. 

What are my legal rights, what should I do now, and who can I contact. I tried looking up tenant rights online but it was sooooo confusing and I'm really right with money so if there is a reliable, cheap, not scammy way to speak to a lawyer that would be nice. 


Ps: I have many other things that I put in the inspection that needs to be fixed like my front door does not fully shut at the bottom and anyone can easily kick it and break in (maintenance came in and told me I needed a whole new door, and I have yet heard anything about it).

&amp;#x200B;

South Dakota here

&amp;#x200B;

I am so done I want to set fire to my rental. My husband and I own a lovely cabin in the woods that we let someone rent with a verbal agreement. Worked for us before, so this person seemed to be no problem.  


Until 7/23/21. She has a BDSM site and often gets drunk with her ""gentleman friends"". Well, this is the third time the cops have been called due to them getting drunk and getting into fights. We saw a deputy bring a camera into the rental to photograph the damages. They arrested this guy behind our house. Enough was enough, we told her to pack her shit and get out.

Nothing.

Served her on 7/28/21 with three day notice to quit.

Nothing.

Served her 8/3/21 with a Enforcible Entry and Detainer Complaint.

Nothing.

AND THEN OUR LAWYER FUCKIN DIED.

I have requested multiple walk-throughs and each time, she's called the cops. Cops tell us ""Let the lawyers figure it out.""

She doesn't have a lawyer. In fact, she's ""visited"" (NOT HIRED) with mostly all our lawyers in this shitty-ass town. All the lawyers we have talked to are either a conflict of interest, or else dead.

Today, I posted a 24 hour notice to vacate so we could renovate. I'm ripping the fuckin doors off to paint them and windows out, IDGAF at this point. The deputy called me and told me, ""noooo, don't do that, you're taking the laws into your own hands!"" I kinda went off on her and told her ""No, this is because all y'all won't uphold the laws and let us walk-through OUR HOUSE and won't evict her. If you would've paid attention to your Civics Laws in that piddly-little shit-hole called the Pierre Academy, you would've known--"" AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.

Should I go full dramatic bitch and follow through with my plan of renovating this house? Are there any tips/steps I should know before I go dumb bitch hours 24/7?

I'm ashamed to admit I got a DUI. This entire thing has been a wakeup call for me. I realized I am alcoholic. I pleaded guilty and since I have no criminal record and it was my first arrest I was sentenced to probation. I have reevaluated my entire life. I'll be starting inpatient rehab transitioning eventually to outpatient. I found a rehab spot before anything happened with my court case because I realize I need help. I am grateful every day I didn't cause a crash or hurt someone. 

I sold my own car to help afford my rehab. Since I don't have a car any longer I declined to have an interlock installed in it.

She has graciously offered to take me in. She also knows someone who will have a full-time job for me.

Here's the problem: My probation officer won't agree to me living with my sister unless she agrees to install an interlock in her car since I would have access to that vehicle by living there. I get this is standard condition. However my sister doesn't own a car due to being blind. She lives in a small town and she walks everywhere. I'll be doing the same. My probation officer insists anyone who lives there needs a car because it's not a city with transit like Springfield or Chicago. I've submitted proof to the office but it isn't enough. I've called the Public Defender's office that represented me but I haven't heard back. Does anyone know if I have an option to appeal or do something since this makes no sense?

I work for the federal government as a mid level manager. I was on a detail in a larger unit from December 2020 until about 2 weeks ago when I had to step down from the position due to constant harassment from a coworker. 

The harassment began in December. Anytime I would address the employee or ask for documentation for absences he would threaten to sue me and use vulgar language. I want to keep this vague. Essentially in feb 2021 he told another employee that he had put his feces on a paper I requested and he put it in a ziplock bag. He told the other employee that he only wanted me to open the bag with the feces in it. 

I informed 10 different people above me of the continuous threatening conduct from December 2020 to august 2021 and nobody helped. I was told that the only option I had was to write him up and when that happened labor dismissed it and settled it without prejudice just “to settle the grievance at the lowest level” and it was removed from his file not to be cited again in the future. 

This employee has filed eeos on me and later said in his own written statement that he did it as a joke and that he didn’t put feces on anything that he said it as a joke to scare me. He also tried to file charges on me at the local police department and the police called me at work to tell me that the employee was making inappropriate claims about me with no evidence and should be given a mental evaluation because he was unstable. 

He has said things such as, by the time he is done with me I won’t be able to get a job at the local trash company, that he called CPS on me, that he had a video of me outside of work and he was showing it to the media and so much more. He has made posts using my entire name on Facebook saying that I’m an idiot and making fun of my relationship with my fiancé.

I had to step down from my position costing me potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars over my career. I also informed hr and other people in positions of power that the harassment is so bad that I had to start therapy and taking medication to cope in feb and also in July. 

After nobody would help me I hired a lawyer and recently was granted a CPO against the employee.

I do not believe I should be responsible for the cost of my lawyer or the medical bills and missed time from work due to the ongoing harassment when I had to protect myself. 

Can anyone help? What’s my next step? EEO against the people I informed of the harassment that allowed it to continue?",legaladvice,Help with harassment or hostile work environment,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6hlhs/help_with_harassment_or_hostile_work_environment/

First off, I'm in Oregon, USA. My partner and I took a motorcycle to a local dealership mechanic to try to track down an electrical gremlin that was preventing it from starting. We also requested a coolant flush, safety inspection, and carburetor cleaning. I'm not sure the timeline matters, but we towed the bike there on 6/14/21. After over a month an a half waiting for the repairs and getting dodgy answers for timeline, we decided to take the bike back. On 8/6/21 we paid for the repairs that had been done, but since it had not been fully fixed we requested them deliver the bike back to our house.

We just received the bike back today. On the initial inspection, it is missing the gas tank, all four spark plug wires, both fuel tank dampers, and who knows what else. It probably goes without saying, but all of these parts were on the bike when we towed it there. It was a complete fully functional bike, with a wire issue somewhere. 

I will be reaching out to the location tomorrow. I'm fairly certain they know there is an issue, but I'm not sure why we wouldn't have gotten a call before they returned it. So far dealing with this location had been tricky and they have been giving us a run around already on trying to get the bike back. I don't have high hopes for an easy resolution for this.

I signed a short-term lease this March that runs from Aug. 1 to Dec. 31 of this year. My goal was to finish my last semester of college before leaving the state. I have one roommate but I signed an individual lease with my landlord. It's been a couple weeks into the lease and my roommate has complained to my landlord a few times (accusing me of entering his room, me leaving lights on in common areas when not using). It was a random roommate pairing and we clearly don't get along well, but I barely see him for the most part and I'm sucking it up because the lease is so short and I don't want to deal with moving. Anyways, my wife was planning to be working full-time out of town but something came up and she needs to stay with me for a few months. My lease says I need to request the landlord's permission for any occupants, but I have a hunch the landlord might find it easier to reject the request because the other roommate has already created hassles and may cause more problems over this, and there's no incentive for them to approve the request since they make the same amount in rent. For what it's worth, my bedroom as per the lease allows up to 2 individuals, but it makes it clear that stays past 30 days in a calendar year need to be approved by landlord. I also worry that, if the landlord denies the request, I could potentially be evicted if they find out I had her stay after not being given permission. I read online that they can't reject the request since I am not adding her as a tenant, only as an occupant, meaning I would be solely responsible for rent and any damages to the bedroom.

Wife had an affair 10 years ago after being married for 16 years, wanted divorce and moved out. We hired an attorney to mediate, agreed to sell the house, split everything, and settled on 8 years of alimony @ $2k/mo. After she moved out, she realized she ""made a huge mistake"" and spent a lot of time and energy winning me back. We had two teenage boys, and I thought it would be good to get back together and try again.

Fast-forward 10 years, and we're just not happy. We're trying to get by without hiring an attorney this time. The difference is that the kids have grown, she has not really worked for almost two years except a couple odd jobs here and there. She is licensed at a particular trade but hates it. She does the grocery shopping and cooks sometimes, but I'm still stuck handling finances and everything else because she's ""just not good at it"". I've worked my way up to about 150k/yr. and work very hard. I feel like my two children are far more mature and well-adjusted than she is, and I am honestly really eager to move on.

She is at a point where she feels bad about all of it, and says she just wants a little place to go with her dog and cat - though she is shopping for houses and I can see her starting to change expectations. Now we're past 20 years of marriage where CT will sometimes grant lifetime alimony. She has historically made very little money, primarily due to lack of motivation - kids have been independent for years.

This is what I think is fair: $220k in retirement, a $15k SUV, and $15k in cash (adds up to half our net worth) + $30k/year for 10 years which would put me close to retirement age. This would allow me to keep my grandfather's farmhouse that I live in with one of my sons - both when the second is home from college. Paying for college is another issue...

I don't want to agree to something and end up having her be completely miserable about it later, and I also don't want to be more generous than I need to be. I've spent a lifetime being too generous. That's just my opinion, but let's assume it's pretty accurate for these purposes.

I had no problems with my current living situation, but had just started a new job and was looking to hopefully get a bigger place. So I agreed to the month-to-month on 8/1. 

10 days later, I received an email from a realtor that my apartment was going to be put up for sale. After calling my LL about it, they told me that this was true and to consider their response 1 month notice. 

By those terms, I am being asked to leave my apartment by 9/11, which is incredibly inconvenient for renting an apartment. 

Being a bit blindsided, LL offered my assistance on finding a place, but fell short at doing so. Instead, I’ve been getting multiple calls a day from LL asking me to sign leases not in my price range ($2.5k/month more than I am paying now). All of these proposed leases have a 9/1 start and LL has heavily implied I need to leave by the start of this month. 

Now I only really have 2 weeks to find a place and move all of my stuff out.  Ideally, 10/1 would be a better time for me so I could find a lease (almost nothing is available 9/1 and nothing is available mid month), but LL seems firm on 9/11.

First off, I live in PA. I recently discovered via a credit monitoring service that someone applied to 6 apartments with my information (name, DOB, address, SSN, driver's license). I've done all the right things so far: credit freeze, initial fraud report on my credit, filed FTC report, and contacted an identity restoration service (btw if you have MyIDCare, you're better off throwing your money away, I've been completely on my own)

I got the names of the leasing screening agency from my credit report, contacted them, and was able to get a copy of 5 of the 6 screening reports (I'm working on #6). From this I was able to determine the apartment names and the info this guy used. I contacted the 5 apartments... 1 didn't care, he's got his money and as long as the rent gets paid he doesn't care; the 2nd is ""investigating"" but I doubt I'll hear anything back, I was clearly annoying her; the 3rd was in DC, I was able to cancel the application before this guy signed a lease; the 4th and 5th (both in VA) had already gotten a lease signed and handed over the keys.

For #4 and #5 they immediately cancelled the lease, had maintenance re-key the locks, told me they'd file a police report, and suggested I do the same. They also tell me this guy is using my PA driver's license with all my info but with his picture on it. So I contacted the local VA PD and I get the following... ""You're not the victim here, the apartment is and it's up to them to file a report if they want to,"" or ""You don't live here so we don't have jurisdiction, go call your local PD."" 

So I did. I walk into my local PD (a major city) and sit for over an hour before a cop comes to take my statement. I spend 20-30 mins giving him the story, all the information I've uncovered, give him the picture of the guy in VA doing this only for him to get to the section that asks ""where did the incident take place?"" I answer: VA and DC. The cop crumbles up the report, throws it out, and yells at me ""Do I look like a VA or DC officer?!? Get the hell outta here! We can't arrest people in VA and DC!""

So here's my question:  **WHO THE %\*&amp;$ HAS JURISDICTION?!?** And why won't any police department give me a damn report?? I've literally done all the investigating, I have the guy's address and picture, but no one seems to want to do anything. Is there something I'm missing? Someone else I can go to? I feel like my next step is just to complain to some AG offices or my senator/representative who won't be able to do anything anyway.

My attorney was in charge of dispersing funds from house sale (paying off previous homeowners mortgage, paying attorneys involved, paying real estate agents, etc). Recently, the previous homeowners and I were informed that there was still a mortgage lien on the property (I am the new homeowner). 

The mortgage lien comes from the lender of the previous homeowner. Attorney was supposed to pay off that lien with the funds acquired from the house sale. Legally, the house is mine (according to the title). However, because of the lien, the previous homeowners lender still does have rights to my house.

Despite the debt not being acquired under my ownership, the lien is placed on the house with my name on it.

My father-in-law needs elder care. He lives alone in a trailer that is a biohazard with human waste in containers around a broken toilet. There is garbage and mold everywhere. It is the textbook image of a hoarding nightmare.

His health has been failing over the last few years. He cannot safely drive and had been involved in several accidents. We already submitted a letter of concern about this through the Kansas DMV.

He was recently admitted to the hospital. He collapsed in his home and was trapped for almost a week before someone found him and he was brought in, and assigned an adult protective services worker. After a week, he was transfered an elderly rehabilitation facility in Missouri. This is paid for by insurance for only another week, after which he will be released.

He intends to return to his trailer and his old life. He is unwilling to accept the gravity of his living situation and his inabilities.

We were hoping adult services would tell him he cannot return to his house; however, his case worker and the State of Kansas say that the case is closed because he's currently receiving care in the facility even though that is temporary.

He had been deemed competent by health care services.

We are not willing to push for guardianship, but do have a relative willing and able to assist him if he moves to a full time care facility near them.

Hopefully this is better; **bold text, when read together, should provide a rough TL;DR**

NOTE: I am mostly seeking advice about a statement that I might use to try to force my landlady to drop some rules and restrictions that are probably violating ORS 90.262; I've included the entire conflict here because I'd also welcome thoughts/advice about my strategy and how to handle the situation going forward.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**My landlady lost her temper last Wednesday (8/11), and since then she has  placed multiple restrictions on my activities outside without good reason. I am not in violation of any terms on the lease, which is month-to-month.** I have lived here for about 1.5 years; the landlady lives here, and there are two other people renting bedrooms (total of 4).

I was working on a gardening project that she approved, but her communication about anything other than rent/utilities/mundane things tends to be highly inconsistent, and  she does not remember approving my use of large rocks. She destroyed a part of my garden the morning of 8/11 in a fit of rage, and came to my bedroom door at 8 AM, screaming, to remove the rest of the rocks in the garden. Previously we agreed that I would make some drawings to show her alternatives that would serve the same functions; she denied this conversation happened.

Her tirade continued after I arrived home from work that day, **when she spontaneously introduced a number of rules and restrictions (apparently applying only to me).** These include, but are not limited to:

\- Requiring me to move plants from a location previously approved (and suggested) by her

\- Requiring me to move/reorganize gardening supplies from locations that were never off-limits

\- Forbidding any work outside after 5 PM (there was previously a more reasonable limit)

There are others, but they are all of a similar nature, and I am aiming for as much brevity as possible.

**None of the demands to remove/relocate plants, materials, or supplies were implemented due to safety/injury/property damage risks; the manner in which they were introduced was that of an intimidation attempt or a power trip, and they were only applied to me.** In general, her communication towards me since the incident described above has taken a form more similar to harassment/intimidation. **Based on the information available on the oregonlaws website, the manner in which these were introduced seems like a violation of ORS 90.262.** 

I have attempted to communicate with her about these things; I am a reasonable person, and the landlady/tenant relationship has been great so far, but she has refused any kind of negotiation with me over these, and has ceased to respond to texts. She has claimed that she communicated some of the above as requests in the past, but in almost every case, she's either rescinded her request, her request was unclear to begin with, or the request was actually never made.

 **I am not willing to acquiesce to these demands because I have several extremely important deadlines approaching, one of which involves a major step towards my dream career.** Taking the time to satisfy her demands would gravely threaten these deadlines, and I've already done a lot of extra work (without rent trade/reductions) for her. Even outside of this incident, she tends to disrespect my time or have unreasonable expectations of me, particularly in the last 4 months.

She has also lapsed in her duties as my landlady, in ways that comprise infractions of state law and city code that she hasn't resolved. I've mentioned those to her a few times but she hasn't done enough to remedy them.  These include (but are not limited to):

\- Signs (and smells) of a potentially backed-up drain line. Water backs up into the sink/dishwasher, and it always smelled bad, but recently it has smelled VERY bad, like raw sewage.

\- A growing ant problem, with colonies of 3 species (two smaller ant species, plus carpenter ants) established somewhere in/around the house. It's bad enough that they regularly get into food.

\- Bathroom fan is broken, and bathroom is beginning to have mold problems.

Ordinarily, I'd be more forceful about these problems, but because of the pandemic and her financial situation, I've been trying to take it easy and help her with ""DIY"" fixes when applicable. She has also been extraordinarily accommodating of my own struggles; **I don't think she is aware that these are potentially serious issues for her, and that there's been some mutualism in the sense that I've held back on complaints because she's accommodated my own struggles.**

**I am already working on finding a different place to live in case things get really bad, but that would also constitute a serious threat to my other obligations/deadlines** because moving is inherently disruptive.

Given these details, I intend to convey the following, via an email that will include any relevant links to oregon laws (via the oregonlaws website) and city codes:

\- Her new rules/restrictions/demands are probably in violation of ORS 90.262

\- Her conduct as my landlady has generally been unsatisfactory (very little official communication in writing, highly inconsistent, etc.)

\- I intend to acquire a legal defense (this is not a bluff) if she does not rescind the rules/restrictions she introduced.

\- Formally communicate that I've been lenient about lapses in her duties because of leniency in kind, but I won't continue to do so under these circumstances. 

**My overall goal is to protect my other obligations and deadlines by forcing the landlady to leave me alone unless she is open to negotiation. I would also prefer to keep my plants, etc. for the time being.** It is somewhat likely that I will move in the future, but I really need to try to put that off until spring/summer of 2022 if possible.

I do have friends who would be willing to ""babysit"" my plants, but most of them are carnivorous plants; the carnivorous plants must be grown in tubs of distilled water, and I cannot transport plants and water simultaneously without renting a pickup truck, etc. **Since I am considering a move anyway, I'd have to move these twice if a friend cares for them; I really don't have the time/money for that.**

I've succeeded against another problematic property manager via the same tactic (demonstration of infractions via email) but **I also want to point out that she's lapsed in her duties as my landlady, I've been super lenient about it for her benefit, and I won't let it go any longer if she's going to treat me like a criminal for a simple misunderstanding about the desired style of her garden.**

**How do I bring this up without making it sound like blackmail?** I can't think of a way to phrase this other than ""If you don't change behaviors I can't let these conditions go any more""; I really just want this entire situation out of my damn way, but I also don't want to open myself up to legal trouble because my statement sounds like blackmail. 

**Is my concern reasonable? Does anybody know if making a statement like that could give her an opening to accuse me of blackmail?**

In case it's relevant, this entire situation has affected my mental health. I struggle with an executive function disorder, an anxiety disorder, and low self-esteem. The events of 8/11 had a noticeable effect on my mental health, and have caused complications as far as managing the executive function disorder. **Not sure if I can use this to force her to leave me alone, but it seems worth mentioning.**

I’m not sure where to get one and how I will even get it imported into this country, but before I worry about all of that I wanted to know whether possession of knuckledusters is legal if it is classified as an antique or collectible, like the rest of my weapon collection.

P.S: I’m planning on expanding my collection and buy samurai swords, antique machetes and other large knives, but I’m still new to my hobby of collecting dangerous weapons.

But my initial and final question is, am I allowed to be in possession of a pair of knuckledusters if they were put out on display or are knuckledusters completely banned in the UK, even possession of them as antique/souvenirs/collectibles. 

Just asking before I pursue to find one so I don’t get into any legal trouble. Thanks.",legaladvice,Can I be in possession of these as souvenirs/collectibles/antiques?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6gah0/can_i_be_in_possession_of_these_as/

Back in June before signing the lease, I reached out to the broker for the landlord’s contact information so that I could inform him that I have an ESA dog. The broker let me know that he would just contact the landlord on my behalf. Since then, me and my two other roommates have signed the lease and paid first months rent + brokers fee + the security deposit. The security deposit has also already been placed in a bank with a W-9 filled out. However, even though we signed the lease and deposited these fees over a month ago, the landlord would not sign the lease until move-in on September 1. 

Because I never heard back from the landlord about providing documentation for my ESA and I knew I could not just show up with my dog on September 1st when we would finally be getting the lease, I reached out to the landlord personally today to inform him of my dog. He then called me and yelled over the phone saying that he was never told by the broker and that he would refuse to sign the lease, would not let me in there and that he does not care if I have documentation. I informed him that I have a legal right to request accommodations and can provide a letter from a licensed professional stating my disability and need for emotional support animal. 

The broker is trying to talk to landlord for us and explain to the landlord that they have to provide reasonable accommodation. He also informed me that because our security deposit was accepted and the lease formally filed, that we technically still had a legally binding agreement. Is this true and if the landlord is still refusing to sign our lease what are my options?

Before we start, I'd like to start by saying pardon for my English typing skill, but if some of you could endure this big wall of text, it will make me happy in this dark time of my life. I want to put this relationship with this girl in situation first, then come with questions that I need advice with. I'll try to make this short...

I met this girl online, we fell in love, I proposed to her after a year, knowing it wasn't the best idea but it was a risk to take to have a good life. She was in Canada with a visa for work, and because of her school background, getting married would help her move on with her life faster and easier. I do not believe she did try to scam me from the beginning, but it sadly went downhill afterward and let me explain this. 

Let's fast forward 6 months after getting married, we live together at my parent house, waiting for our condo to be build, stuck at home because of covid. This is where it get ugly. I'm going to try to be transparent as much as possible, and will clarify if needed. 

She was saying I did change from the beginning, that I lost the romantic touch, that I was cold to her, and that I spent too much time gaming, criticize her friends, trying to control everything, and talk about money way too much (exemple: where to spend intelligently). In my defense, my biggest mistake was to not tell her how I was feeling suffocating with  her around when i was working at home. It was almost a new job that I needed to adapt. I barely game when she was around, I played when she was asleep in the morning and rarely at night with my friends in which I would always ask her if I could play with my friends online (it would happen like once every 2 week). I made comments about her friends that she just met, just to warn her to always be on her guard. I didn't want her to go out because there was still no vaccine back then, and not only I was a scared baby to get the covid, but also that my parents are 65-70 and I didn't want to harm them. There was curfew too and fines if we did not respect the law. But trust me, I wanted her out of the house sometimes so I could have my ""me"" time. 

Then one day, after seeing her talk to the phone often in the bedroom alone or in the living room, I took the phone and check her message. My heart was shattered when I saw my wife texting and flirting with a co-worker. I said that if she wanted that kind of freedom to do that kind of talk with other people, it would be better out of the house. A few days later she moved out. We did try to solve thing but without success. She kept texting him and all. I moved in with her to try to make thing better, but then noticed thing wasn't right. Her lying that she was out but she was with the guy. Anyway, the worst happened, and they slept together. 

This is where I need your help. 

I need to know what I can do, because we are still in the process of me sponsoring my wife. Of course she doesn't want me to cancel the process or getting divorce or else she would have to go back to her country.  She is threating me to bring me to court and take half of my asset which is around 100k. Her argument is that when I caught her cheating, I angrily texted her ""I want my 50k back + 50k from your parents and I'll do your papers, now leave me alone"". I lend her 50k to put in a TFSA account because we did cancel our condo and money sitting in a bank is never good. She gave me back my 50k but said I can lose more than half because of this text in criminal. Overall, I lost way more because of the wedding rings, the renting when she moved out (I paid 100% of it), 2 luxurious bags and even sent money to her parents a few times. I want an outcome that I don't lose more than I already did. 

We have a joint account with 0$ money in it that I transferred in my personal account, but the money that I got back from the cancellation of the condo (100% of it is mine but we signed together) is legally hers too? 

She already spoke with a lawyer. And the outcome doesn't look nice for me. I just want her out of the country, she's doesn't deserve a citizenship. She definitely doesn't deserve any of my hard work money. She work illegally under the table because she has no work visa. I basically lost 2 years of my life and wasting money on her.

Last fall I was a nanny for three kids. I knew the parents very well as I used to date the father's brother so if I sound extra lenient that is why and I know that my leniency may be difficult to deal with in court. At the start of my job as a nanny I would work 14 hours days regularly and was paid on Sundays usually. After a few months of that I began working for the family 24 seven for three weeks at a time, and then I would have a day or two off if I was lucky, and then go back at it for three weeks. The parents would be gone during this time and out of the city. I was supposed to be paid $2000 per week for 24/7 care. When it came down to non-payment issues and the mother doing job-training, I allowed them to pay me $1000 a week and a running tab for when she made the ""great"" money she implied she would have soon, as long as I got some money every week. Eventually this lead to them being completely unacceptable with compensation and me not letting them abuse me further. However, when I quit, I still had to care for the children for an extended period of time because they were out of town and I was decent enough to give notice although they far from deserved it. After quitting in December, they have not given me a dime in 8 months. I have asked a lawyer that is a family friend to send them a certified letter to see if we could resolve this but I have had no luck yet. I had Offered to do a payment plan with them to which they said months ago was not viable. Given that I knew she was behind on bills because her husband was financially irresponsible, the reason she took over on making payments to me halfway through the position, and because she had upcoming surgery and would not be able to work, I did not ask again until she was fully recovered. I have not heard anything from them in May when she said she couldn't do a payment plan because of her situation. I would accept any sort of payment plan at this point, even $20 a week. However, I've seen the father posting on social media about new speaker system for his truck, etc. 

The only evidence I have is of me being at the house constantly last fall, in the text between us coordinating things for the kids last fall, and in-text saying she owes me. The total is over $9000. They also did not compensate me for gas as they said, which was around 800 miles. I tracked it every week. Do you think this would stand up in small claims court if I took it to that? What should I do here? Is leaving tryout kids with an unpaid nanny child abandonment and grounds for reporting? The next childcare provider may not be as easy to abuse as I was. 

$9000 is life-changing money to someone like me and I am sick to my stomach having provided around 700 hours of free labor for such terrible people. If you want to know why I was such an idiot and sticking around so long, I had watched their three-year-old grow up since he was a baby as I was part of the family and saw them as my nieces and nephew. I had done one-off babysitting gigs and free sitting since he was six months. 

I jokingly it's considered making a gofund me page for them and putting it over Facebook where people they know can see and donate hoping they'd figure their stuff out because they wanted it off of there. This would be my last hope if there's no legal grounds, could I get in trouble for using their names on this? I understand it is completely ridiculous but they deserve it, and so much more.

A few weeks ago my boss (a family friend) invited me to stay with her because my brothers (who I live  with) had covid, and assured me I could bring my dog, a small pomchi puppy named Duncan. We stayed there for 3 weeks before I went home for a few days when my brothers got better, then went back with Duncan in tow last Wednesday 8/11 to work. She invited me to stay the night and to cut out unnecessary details I ended up staying another night. So on Friday 8/13 I left my dog at my bosses house while I went to work, which she assured me was fine as long as I shut all the room doors and made sure there was nothing he could chew up. At about 6 that night I get a call from her saying two of her friends came to her house (while no one else was there) and they let Duncan out and he wouldn’t come when they called him, so I needed to get there as soon as I could. Duncan was missing for a complete 24 hours when we got a call from a local vet saying he had been hit by a car. So now we are faced with a hefty vet bill to cover the surgery Duncan needs. My question is what would be the better legal action to take; should I sue the guy who let him out, or should I file a claim with my boss’s homeowners insurance? And would either of these even be feasible? If he claims to have been there working would his job’s liability insurance cover it?

Now I will get on to why I’m suspicious of foul play, for whatever it’s worth in this situation, I’m not sure if any of this is relevant to my questions. It is also just a little bit of venting. First thing is that I was told by my boss that it was two of her friends that were there when he was let out, upon arriving to her house ~10 minutes after receiving that phone call, only one of her friends was there, sitting on the back porch smoking pot. He never helped look or offered up any helpful information, couldn’t even tell me which way Duncan had run. The next morning he saw me and told me that he had put his foot forward to block the door but my dog had zoomed past anyway. This is odd for two reasons, the first being that on the only two other occasions my dog had met this man he hated him and wouldn’t go near him. The second being that he stated he entered through the back porch, which has two separate screened in areas. Meaning there were 3 doors between my dog and outside so two of the doors had to have already been propped open. On top of the fact that no one can answer to me why he was there or inside of the house in the first place, and also that in his story the other man, that my boss said was there, never actually was. (This I am trying to give the benefit of the doubt to, as it could have just been a miscommunication). The second seed of suspicion was planted by my boss. While we were staying there Duncan chewed up a flat iron (that I replaced) and a pair of her shoes (which I offered to replace as well). On multiple occasions I heard her complaining about that and also saying he chewed up one of her Louis Vuitton bags which never happened, but she never made it clear (when I was present, which was for the whole conversation on 2 separate occasions) that she was joking. Once Duncan went missing she never really seemed concerned and when I let her know we found him and that he was injured all she had to say was “oh no... glad you found him.” Coming from a woman who only a week prior was telling me that she missed him, was requesting “joint custody,” and offered to babysit him while I was at work. On Sunday I asked her to clarify for me what exactly she knew happened, she told me that she didn’t even know I wasn’t there when it happened, which doesn’t make sense when you consider she was the one that called me to alert me. Yesterday my brother spoke with her and she told him that she didn’t even know my dog was at the house that day. For this blatant lie, I have a picture of her sitting with my dog just the night before. The third and final thing that makes me suspicious, which I haven’t been able to confirm yet, but am in the works of doing so, is that it looks on the vet’s paperwork like Duncan was found ~5 miles away from where he went missing. As I said this isn’t confirmed, but it is an interesting detail.

Background: I recently just moved out of an apartment which I lived in for six years. I recently received my security deposit check back (although I haven’t cashed it yet, pending the advice given) and there was a $190 deduction taken out for carpet cleaning. The carpet was new when I moved in, and was vacuumed regularly, but there was no other maintenance like shampooing done. There were some small stains around (I think coffee) that were pointed out during the last walkthrough. Although the carpet was certainly not abused or neglected. 

I’m not contesting the stains, but rather the fact that given the age of the carpet, I would think this falls under normal wear and tear. According to IRS publication 527, the general depreciation schedule for carpet in a rental property is 5 years. Therefore, is it really reasonable for the landlord to claim that this falls outside of normal wear and tear (and therefore the tenant’s responsibility)?  I would imagine they’d have to shampoo six year old carpet between tenants anyway, and this is just a way to unfairly subsidize some of their costs, but I could be wrong. 

Lastly, I do just want to make a note that I actually transferred to a larger unit within the same complex. I think this is relevant for context for a few reasons. First, I don’t want to put a target on my back. And second, the complex virtually treated us like new tenants, making us go through the application process, adding on a common area fee that we were previously grandfathered out of, finding an apartment that overlapped our current lease (and therefore paying rent for two apartments simultaneously for about 2 and a half weeks), etc., all to ultimately lease a more expensive apartment from them.",legaladvice,[NY] Carpet Cleaning Cost Deducted from Apartment Security Deposit,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6fokh/ny_carpet_cleaning_cost_deducted_from_apartment/

I went to a comedy club in Oklahoma City to see Trevor Wallace do stand up. Great show, highly recommended but the only thing I paid for at the show was 2 burger quesadilla meals and 2 dr.peppers totalling up to maybe $30 so I handed my waiter my card on the trey they provided and waited to get my card back. I was left waiting half an hour after the show had ended only to be handed someone else's card and then told my card was lost. They said cards sometimes get stuck on the bottom of treys which is a concern of its own but I was given 4 free tickets to any show as compensation then sent on my way.

At 1am or so, now the next day I had noticed I was charged $42.50 from some random club in OKC that I've never been to. I don't live that kind of life. I locked my card for the first time, I didn't know I could do that through the app.

After waking up I noticed that I had a text from the comedy club saying that my card was returned by a guest with a name that I will not say. The text also included this man's phone number.

I noticed today that instead of a $30 charge on my card, I had received a charge for $72.33 from the comedy club. I do not have a $30 charge for my food at all.

I called my bank and am having all of these charges disputed but my card was given away and used by a stranger and neglected by the comedy club by paying for someone else's food. The club and the man who used my card should both be held responsible but I have never sued anyone before.

I will start by saying that my parents are my medical guardians due to me having a lot of social, medical, and other disabilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in 2017 I was approached by these 4 girls at an event I was at. I was at this event to support a woman who I felt was my friend. Due to my challenges I wasn't able to pick up on the cues that I was being used. one of the 4 girls (who I thought at the time was one of the woman's friend) told me the woman I was supporting is into bondage, stripping and more and I was asked if I could help find her a person to due kinky things to her and all I needed to do was to post an ad somewhere online to find someone to get her. Unfortunately I bought right into this due to the fact the girl said she was consenting and that I didn't need to ask her for confirmation as she would pretend she wasn't into it due to shyness. I went ahead and posted the ad. A few months later I was sent to court by the woman who claimed my ad was asking someone to adbuct her. This I did not say in my ad but there was another ad the woman presented as evidence which my parents and I believe was made by possibly one of the 4 girls or the woman herself. It just so happened the date and time of this ad that was posted was at the same time I was at work so essentially what happened was the judge dismissed the case and graciously understood I was trapped into something I wasn't cognitively capable of understanding at the time. 

Fast forward to 3-4 years later and this same woman and current boyfriend is claiming Im still talking about this with others which is not true. In fact after the ad was posted my parents setup trackers on my devices to know what I was looking at and who I was talking to. They have full logs of what sites I visit, the times and dates yet this same woman and her boyfriend says it's definitely me and that the trackers can be manipulated. My parents know for a fact they can't be as they have passwords to the trackers which I don't know and there is a setting that if I try to even override it it sends one of my parents a notification that I tried changing the password or whatever. 

Does anyone know what I can do? I'm from Vermont but this Woman is located in NJ. My parents and I just want this to stop and are hoping there is some way to get this woman to stop coming after me. Multiple accounts are made and then I'm sent messages about it. I block the accounts and don't respond but it's gotten so bad that someone called me on my phone telling me I need to stop talking to girls about kinky things or else I would be busted and that someone was after me to murder me. My parents reported this to the police who basically said they couldn't do anything because the number that called me was private and unlisted. I should also mention back when I first was interacting with this woman she publicly tweeted to me on her account that she was into bdsm and kinky role play so that didn't help me out either in terms of thinking this wasn't okay and even though I have blocked her since the court date my parents told me this tweet is still public on her twitter account and their thinking is that anyone who knows about this has seen the tweet or the woman shares it around to try to get me in trouble and it seems she doesn't do her part in trying to remove this issue as my parents said she follows bdsm accounts and interacts with them constantly on her various social media.",legaladvice,Being Harassed and not sure what to do.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6fg5s/being_harassed_and_not_sure_what_to_do/

I let her visit him on and off for a while but when I pulled the plug she decided to sue me for him. 

Before filing the lawsuit she sent the police to my house twice and told them that I stole her service animal. The dog is not a service animal, he is only registered on a scam website for emotional support animals so the police could not do anything. 

I regret not letting her see him when she wanted to because now I am possibly losing the most important part of my life. I don't know who I am without him and I fear the future without him around.  The reason that I fear going to court is because she paid for him, his microchip is in her name, and he is registered with the AKC under her name. 

The only things I know that I have going for me consist of me being the primary caregiver since we got the dog, and I financially took over in the summer of 2020 because she could not afford his food anymore. Some of the vet receipts have my card number on them even though he is registered under her name with the vet. We also participate in dog sports which is my favorite thing to do together. Additionally she has a history of hitting her best friends dogs but I cant prove that unless her best friend confirms my claims the judge, and considering that she will likely be loyal to her best friend I have a feeling that she may lie.

Recently during a zoom meeting my co-worker made some comments that I thought were racist. He didn't necessarily target it at anyone, but he just went on a rant about how PC and liberal things had gotten and added some stereotypes and tropes that I found offensive, such as that most tech jobs go to Indians, brown people commit most of the violent crimes, police target blacks because they commit most of the crimes, etc. 

I raised these concerns with my manager and she said she agreed the comments were offensive and would have a talk with him, and that was that.

In addition, both before and after this incident, I had complained to my manager about my co-worker for other reasons. Mainly that he's rude and difficult to work with and often is even bullying. During meetings he often cuts people off. He is very quick to take credit for other people's work or quickly agree if he thinks an idea is good and spin it so that it sounds like the idea was his. If he disagrees, he very rudely interrupts, interjects, and does everything possible to make the person sound like an idiot. 

This behavior got worse recently so I complained a couple of times to my manager, who said she'll talk to him, but things didn't really get better. So I went to HR and mentioned all the things above, including the racial comments, and they said they'd investigate.

Then a month later I was told I was being let go. They said it's due to economic reasons due to the pandemic, but I'm pretty sure that's hogwash as our organization is busy as heck. The timing is suspicious as hell, and I've never had a negative review in the 10 years I've been here.

I caught up with an old co-worker that worked with the co-worker in question in the past, and he echoed everything I said. That the guy was rude, bullying, and made racially insensitive comments. He had gone to HR with these complaints but nothing ever seem to happen, so he kinda got the impression that he was being protected for some reason. I guess I learned that the hard way.

I mean I'm assuming I don't have legal recourse since this wasn't a manager acting this way towards me plus I can't really prove that my complaints were the reason for my firing.

So I live in Hawaii.. Last week I was working at my surf shop when a truck intentionally drove into the building. It missed me by a literal foot coming 30 miles an hour into the glass doors. It was an incredibly traumatic experience. It drove through multiple times, backing up and barely missing me as i fled the shop in what i think was an intentional attempt at hitting me.  
So the kid driving was a 20yo known mentally ill person who i identified as he drove away from the scene. There is actually very detailed video of the event and everything explained because of the shops internal and external security cams.  


I was the only person in the shop.  


This person (the offender) ive had very little contact with in the past, however it is a small island and so i did know his face. I told detectives at the scene about my connection to this person. He has a history of stalking a girl and her twin sister, we'll call em D and A, both of which I am friends with. I have in the past had a psuedo romantic relationship with D. He lives in the same neighborhood as them and is known to follow and harass them. The last person that came into the shop before he did this was one of these girls, A. When she was leaving I ran out into the parking lot with her to grab something from my shop. I believe he saw me with her then and snapped. This is not his first time attacking property or people over these girls.  


A few months ago my roommate Eli, who is also friends with the girls, was parked at their house when this exact same person walked by and smashed Elis car up with an edging brick. The police were called but the charges dropped. Still, a police report exists. I told the detective this and stressed that there is a high likely hood of him stalking her into the shop.  
As i said, i told detectives all of this. Since then, everyone including the detective have admitted it looks intentional.  


The MPD arrested him on criminal property damage 1 and as far as i know intend on limiting it at that.  
I believe more charges should be tacked on for the intentional endangerment and possible attempted assault with a truck, however i am unaware of how to pressure the PD or prosecution into doing so.  


I also believe I should be entitled to some form of compensation for the incident, it was very traumatic, frightening and was an altogether awful experience. Ive lost sleep, missed work (the shop is partially open again after emergency contracting temporarily sealed the damage.) , and definitely experience post trauma stress.  


I was contacted today by the building owner who asked if i intended on pressing charges. He explained that the insurance claim only took affect on accidental damage to the building and was wondering if id be willing to hold off from pressing charges in order to allow the insurance claim to go through. (They would however go through with the charge of CPD1). I would like for the building owner to receive the money he is entitled to in order to fix the building, however I would also like to press charges and file for emotional distress compensation, and compensation for loss of wages.  


I was told by someone that one avenue i could take would be asking for the building owner to pay out a sum of the money to me in order to avoid the whole process.  
I know another way would be to contact an attorney, however i have no idea on where to even start with that and i do not have the money to pay out of pocket..  
I need advice on how to propose to receive this and what avenue to pursue..  


TLDR: I need help with:  


\-Negotiating additional charges with Prosecution or PD  


\-Navigating sketchy compensation land  


\-Finding an attorney and how to approach the situation.",legaladvice,"A truck drove through my building while I was Working, nearly killing me. Seeking emotional distress compensation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6f2tu/a_truck_drove_through_my_building_while_i_was/

I get a call from the President of the company I work for on my lunch break on 8/16/2021.

However I know of multiple employees that work out of state (remote) with no issue. One being my supervisor. 

The VP who signed the letter of understanding, calls me later that afternoon to confirm what the President of company said. He stated if I stayed in state they’ll keep me under the remote position. But if I moved to UT I would not be able to continue employment in that company. He offered to keep me under payroll until the end of September.

They haven’t disclosed what exactly they mean by tax issue.

I believe this puts my child in unnecessary danger of illness or death while pursuing an activity the government mandates.

One of my father's friend passed away two months ago. They were both very close and the friend would allow my father to store a lot of his belongings on the property, he couldn't hold onto them due to his own financial and living situation (think shipping container amount of stuff). Before he could remove the belongings from the property, the friend passed. My father was in contact with the friend's daughter, who arranged for him to get the shipping container off the property and moved elsewhere.

My father advised the daughter that some of the more important, and valuable, family belongings were kept inside the home to prevent any damage from staying in a storage container. She assured him that she would look for the belongings and let him know as soon as possible. A month and a half has passed since then and she is just saying that she hasn't gotten to it yet.

My father's main concern comes from a text he received from the friend's daughter saying something along the line of: ""If the daughter from her mom's side goes through the home, then she will definitely steal it"".

That shook my dad up quite a bit, and the daughter is still not letting him onto the property to retrieve what is his. Unfortunately, there is no solid evidence like a picture or receipt for any of this as they were simply passed down, but we do have multiple witnesses that can confirm said belongings have been in our possession.

I’m a casino employee in an at will state, and I was terminated following a first offense after 9.5 years of an unblemished employment history (zero mistakes that require disciplinary action).

My casino recently rolled out a side bet on a game that sees heavy action, and usually at high dollar amounts. They did not train the staff properly at all (under two hours of training for something that typically warrants 30 hours + at minimum). Most dealers barely understood the main game let alone the additional side bet (which is at issue here). 

An important detail is that in the casino business, table games specifically (think blackjack and craps, not poker), employees are given frequent breaks to prevent the mental fatigue that accompanies dealing with large numbers at such a rapid pace. Breaks occur traditionally for 30 minutes at 90 minute intervals to prevent mistakes.

At this point in the evening I was left unsupported by management for over 2.5 hours, more than an hour past the time a break is to be given. During that time I was working at a harried pace, adhering to policies and procedures that kept me busy constantly, and I was fulfilling my responsibilities diligently. There is evidence of this.

One of the dealers thought a side bet had hit when it had not. Due to a lack of training (I know the main game very well, 500+ hours experience) I also thought the bet was good. It was paid to two players totaling $10K. I approved the payout.

My mistake was not contacting the shift manager or surveillance before giving approval. My only excuse was that I knew surveillance was watching the game as I had been in touch with them almost every 15 minutes. They did not catch the mistake either. I had also been in constant contact with the shift manager who knew exactly what was happening in my section, and had been negligent in providing the appropriate support.

When the mistake was caught, the company bypassed standard disciplinary measures and placed me on immediate suspension. Days later I was terminated. It is important to note that the money was recovered from the players and the company did not suffer a loss. Also, I had been working to the best of my ability with the company’s best interests in mind.

I feel I was a scapegoat when the typically appropriate response is a written warning. The company bypassed a written warning, performance improvement plan,  and a final warning and proceeded directly to termination following a first offense.

Hey guys, so I moved into my current apartment about 4 months ago now. The apartment had several repair issues that needed to be taken care of so we asked our landlord to sign riders expressing that he would fix them before we moved in. He signed them. Among them were repairing the broken buzzer and a leaky roof in one of the bedrooms. He did not fix these before we moved in but we didn't make too big of a deal of it at the time. We simply asked him again to fix these issues. Since then I think I brought up the buzzer in particular to him like 4 times. He visited the place once to take a look at it. Said he needs to order new parts and left. It's been almost 2 months since that day. The broken buzzer has caused me to miss my package delivery so many times now that it's just become a part of life I've accepted. That and the fact that the roof leaks every time it rains.

Finally, after 4 months of this shit I'm fed up. I filed a violation against my landlord with the agency that takes care of this sort of thing in my city. Apparently now they are supposed to contact him about this problem and if he doesn't take care of it within 8 days I can pursue him in housing court. I don't expect him to take care of this problem in that time frame knowing this fucking asshole. So I would love to know what my options are. How does housing court work? Would I be provided an attorney? What kind of evidence would I be required to present? What kind of consolation would even come out of a legal suit? I don't really know what to expect with this moving forward and I'd like some advice and if anyone has been through a similar situation.

BIG UPDATE: So I just looked up the status of my HPD complaint and according to the website he is not even registered with HPD, which is the housing government agency in NYC. I don't know if that is illegal or if he has more time to register or what but whenever I search up my HPD claim on the website it says in big highlighted letters on the page for the property I live at:  ""THIS PROPERTY IS NOT CURRENTLY VALIDLY REGISTERED WITH HPD."" Surely there is some kind of legal case here?

PS: Btw there are other problems with the apartment too but these are the ones I'm focused on because we have him agreeing to take care of them in legal writing and a history of asking him to take care of the issue and him just not doing shit.",legaladvice,My landlord has failed to repair issues we have been complaining about for over 4 months now.

The whole idea was that they could complete the job in three weeks, and there'd still be time between completion and the birth of our second child. We chose a high price (IMO) of $44k under the assumption that it was worth it to get the backyard done before the baby was born. For context, we had just moved into a new house and the backyard was completely dirt. I'm in California. 

The landscaper started on time, and we paid the agreed upon $13k to start the project. During the project some smoke from some nearby fires caused delays because it was unhealthy for the workers. We completely understood, and rolled with it. In time, the landscapers got most of the work done, but they left a 10ft by 20ft section of our yard as dirt (it shouldn't have been), and they hadn't yet acquired the bushes or the trees. Specifically, there was supposed to be an orange tree, which was a focal point of one corner of the backyard. 

As it got closer to the due date of the baby, I became concerned if they could complete on time. I have lengthy text message conversations with our rep asking about updates, and all I'd get back are excuses. In one of the messages, our rep told me that they need to go out of state to search for an orange tree. Somehow I bought that excuse, but this is California, and of course that excuse is completely bogus, as I'll mention below. 

I should note here that about this time I got an invoice for the second tranche of cash which was predicated on materials being received. Technically, besides the trees and bushes all the materials had been received, including lots of paver stones. I didn't (and still have yet to) pay this invoice. At the time there was no real reason except I'm bad with email and our rep hadn't asked me in person. 

Two days before my daughter's due date, I asked for another status update. The message I received back was, ""[Operations] is contacting me back with the update on the tree and bushes. I've ordered 2cy of mulch and we'll do everything in one day when the plants arrive."" This turned out to be the last update I received, as from that point on they went completely dark. No mulch arrived at my house, and neither did the trees and bushes. 

Soon after that my daughter was born and as you can imagine my mind went elsewhere. There was no communication between the rep and I for another five months, where I get a text message from him saying he wants to ""get our project completed."" By that point I had completed the job myself, filling the dirt area with mulch, and acquiring the trees and bushes. I didn't save receipts, but I did take pictures of what it looked like beforehand. As an aside here, I was able to get an orange tree from a local nursery down the street, without any out of state search or hassle. Miffed, I don't respond to him. 

Two months later the rep starts showing up at my house during work hours. I can never answer the door because I'm in meetings all day (nor do I want to), and he eventually sends me an email continuing to push to ""complete the job"". In response I tell him, shortly, that we no longer need his services, and he responds, ""Great! I'll have accounting forward you the rest of the bill."" At that point, I send a scathing email to both him and accounting, saying that they never completed the work, which was supposed to be completed before my daughter was born, and at this point my daughter is sitting up and eating solid food. Honestly, it was some of my best work. 

Following that email, I get a call from both Customer Support and a manager. This is the first time I've heard from Customer Support, ever, and they apologized and all in all didn't treat me like crap. The manager, however, couldn't be bothered. In my conversation with him, he just told me to send him a list of the work they didn't do, and how much it cost me to do it myself. It felt very much like he didn't care, and in the end he was asking me to negotiate against myself, so I didn't send that to him. I never heard back. 

Now, today, a full year after this three-week project started, the President of the landscaping company is calling and emailing me asking to ""settle on the final payment and what discount we can apply for some of the unfinished work"". I of course don't want to pay him because the work was never finished, and it was terrible service. I'm not positive (because I'm not a landscaper, nor do I know what to expect), but I wouldn't be surprised if it was shoddy work as well (I don't have enough space or time to detail that here). 

What am I entitled to here? Do I still owe them $31k for a project they never completed, strung me out on, ghosted me for 5 months, then hounded me to collect? Do I have to treat this as very matter-of-fact and say they completed X of Y, so I owe them for X? Personally, the only thing keeping me from complaining to the contracting board is the fact that I still haven't paid them anything else. $13k was a good price for what they did. Thoughts?

Need to know if my landlord should be responsible for replacing the lawn in my backyard, or if they decline to if I have legal standing to force them to do it. 

Summary:
Part of the irrigation system in my backyard broke, contractually it's my landlord's responsibility to fix it, and it's taken almost 2 weeks to get a maintenance request fully approved (nevermind someone scheduled to come out to fix it). In the past it's only taken 1-2 days. The grass in my backyard is now almost completely dead from a lack of watering in the Vegas summer. I'm pretty sure I'll have to start over from scratch in the fall.

Facts/details:
- About 2 weeks ago, one of the connectors that connects a sprinkler head to the irrigation system snapped. I'm not sure what caused it to snap, but it was discovered when we woke up to discover the back yard flooded.
- I submitted a maintenance request with the property management company the same day. Included in the request was a detailed report noting that the broken component was a part of the underground irrigation system and not the sprinkler head itself. Photos of the intact sprinkler head, broken connector, and the location of the break.
- the maintenance request was rejected late the next day on the grounds that section 15-o&amp;u of my lease agreement calls out sprinkler heads and nominal repairs under $100 are the tenant's responsibility. 
- I didn't see the email for 3 more days (which hurts me), but as soon as I did I emailed the property manager and maintenance department back reminding them that 15-o specifically calls out ""sprinkler heads and above ground irrigation"". The broken component is not a part typically sold as a part of the sprinkler head, and above ground irrigation doesn't apply here as it typically refers to drip irrigation (the part in question is buried under ground anyways).
- I also pointed out that, because it involves some minor excavation, a new riser, sealant, and labor, costs for this type of repair typically range from $125-$250 in my area. Section 15-U also does not apply here.
- the landlord has also set precedent for repairs of this type and cost by twice repairing a leaky valve in the irrigation box.
- After multiple (8) phone calls and 3 emails, I finally got in touch with someone who said ""I don't know why that was rejected, we're supposed to fix that"" and processed a new work order. 
- the landscaper calls me 10 minutes later, i send them the same photos that I sent to the property manager, explained the situation, and was told they usually get approval to proceed from the property manager the same day. I scheduled them to come out the next morning.
- the next day (it's Friday and 8 days since the initial work order was submitted) the landscaper doesn't show. I call them and they advise the property manager hadn't approved the work order. I call maintenance, have to leave a message and call back number, and send a follow up email. I get an automated email that afternoon from the property manager saying the work order has been processed (not approved) and that the landscaper would call me within 24 hours.
- I get no reply over the next 3 days after more calls and emails.
- I finally get someone from the management company on the phone today and they admit the work order approval was just sitting in review. They approve it over the phone. A good chunck of the grass is dead, and now because of the time of day the landscaper cannot come out until tomorrow morning.
- I have been handwatering the grass in the morning and evening every day since to try and keep it alive. There are also 4 fully grown palms and 3 bushes back there that need to be watered too.",legaladvice,Nevada renter looking for advice - do I have legal standing to demand lawn repair,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p6e5aw/nevada_renter_looking_for_advice_do_i_have_legal/

I received an email on August 4th saying that I got my dream job in another country. I immediately sent an email to my landlord to give them notice since  they require a 60 day notice period to vacate. HOWEVER, since I leave October 2nd, he responded saying I was three days late in notifying him and that because there is a ""no move out"" period for October, November, and December, I would have to pay rent until January 31st. The 60 day notice period still applies because according to the contract I signed, the soonest I can notify him would be December 1st. In Minnesota this clause exists because of winter weather (or something like that). I've lived in this apartment for 2+ years and completely forgot that ""no move out"" period existed so I was afraid I was screwed and can't afford to pay 4 months of rent and move to another country. My strongest defense is that this is a month to month lease that ""automatically renews"" according to  MN Stat. 325G.56. 

""For an automatic renewal provision to be enforced, the landlord must give notice to the tenant as provided in this section. The notice must be in writing and direct the tenant's attention to the automatic renewal provision of the lease. The notice must be served personally or mailed by certified mail at least 15 days, but not more than 30 days prior to the time that the tenant is required to furnish notice of an intention to quit.” Minn. Stat. 504B.145. Additionally, such notice must follow the requirements below of Minn. Stat. 325G.56: 

“Written notice provided under this section must clearly and conspicuously disclose:

(1) that the contract will automatically renew if the consumer does not cancel the contract;

(2) the cancellation procedure, which shall allow for cancellation by regular mail or e-mail; and

(3) the dates during which the consumer may cancel the contract.

(b) Written notice under this section must be made in a stand-alone mailing using boldfaced type.”

&amp;#x200B;

Since no notice was provided within the appropriate time period before the lease ended or after the lease ended the renewal clause is invalid and unenforceable correct? Such notice should have been sent seventy-five to ninety days prior to the lease end date. Using this as my defense I sent him this information and after exchanging emails for weeks he is adamant on me paying 4 months of rent and refuses to acknowledge my case or make concessions.  Landlord-tenant law is governed by both contract law and property law -and they didn't follow property law. What can I do at this point? My roommate will have to take them to court since I'll be out of the country.

I noticed that the amount included in the signed lease was significantly less than the amount I actually paid during that timeframe. I went to the leasing office and they agreed I paid approx. $300 more each month for rent than I should have during that time, however because they just sold the property to new owners and hired new property managers, the people currently there really had nothing to do with the overcharges and therefore couldn't really help me. They told me to reach out to the old property manager, which I did, but I am assuming they either won't get back to me, or will tell me it's not their problem since they're no longer associated with the property.

Do I have any legal recourse here? Who would even be responsible for paying me back in this scenario? The old property managers likely will say they paid it to the old owner (which I don't even know who that is), and the new managers/owners are saying it wasn't paid to them so they can't help.

It caused a ton of drama, so I agreed they could continue to store things in my basement with several exceptions: they couldn’t store anything that was non-working, they couldn’t store anything that could survive being in their garage over the winter, and they couldn’t store anything that wasn’t related to the business (they have personal stuff down there too, things like old doors they never installed). They agreed to have those things out of the basement by spring. We’re a month away from fall and everything is still down there.

 Lately she has been just increasingly more problematic, so I offered to read through the whole agreement and see what she can and cannot get away with.
 ***In the Transportation section it states ""The parties agree that Father shall be responsible for transportation during his time sharing.""

The parent agree that the Father may have any of the following pick up the child for his time sharing: Relative 1, Relative 2, Relative 3, Relative 4"" It states there actual names in the agreement of course, I just am leaving it out for obvious reasons.

On Aug 14 I sent them an email (to an address I have proof they use) reminding them of the problem and their duty under the state's Civil Code to make the repairs.

I am posting on behalf of a local non-profit my mom manages about some issues that have been going on.

Background: it is located on public property, residing on a sectioned off piece of land owned by a public school. It is a community garden that works closely with the school. While there is a building, the majority of the garden is outdoors, just fenced in. 

For over a year a family has been coming in and destroying property when no one is there. They have been ripping plants out of the ground, breaking equipment, and stealing food on a regular basis for well over a year. There is video proof from a security camera, photo proof, and multiple witnesses. This has been very frustrating as it is a mainly volunteer run garden. All food that is grown there is donated to local food banks, given to volunteers, or sold to raise money to support the organization. They have destroyed well over 500$ worth of produce, plants, and tools in the past. 

Most recently this week they hit a new low. The garden is home to a small pond of 20 Koi fish used for educational purposes. I know they are just fish but they are greatly enjoyed by several local community remembers. They stole 17 of the Koi. These fish were gifted to the garden, but people could donate 100$ to “adopt a fish” as part of a fund raising event. This family has also harassed the garden’s chicken’s in the past. The organization is run by mostly elderly people and can not afford expensive legal fees. They are worried that because the garden is run on public property they have no legal standing. They know the families license plate number, address, and place of employment, but have never taken legal action. Do they at least have enough standing to file a police report? Is there any legal action they can take? Please keep in mind the family consist of both adults and children doing this.

I'm a longtime driver in CA, USA. No history of traffic tickets, accidents, or other poor driving history (this is relevant later in the story).

I was coming out of a parking structure today and about to turn right. The light was red and there was a ""no turn on red"" sign posted. So, I waited at the light, even though there was no oncoming traffic or people crossing the road. A car came up behind me and, after a few seconds of waiting, the driver honked his horn several times in complaint of me not turning on a red light. He kept pointing right with his finger trying to get me to turn, but I did not. Whatever. He might just be inpatient or he didn't see the ""no turn on red"" sign, I thought.

The light turns green, and literally as soon as it does, this guy slams his hand on the horn even after I've already started moving. And then is tailing me even after I switch lanes to the left lane. I was already driving at the speed limit, but this guy was right on my ass.

We reach the next intersection and as we do, the light is turning yellow. I know I won't be able to make it, so I slow down. This guy gets upset by this and speeds into the Left Turn lane, only to then jump back in front of my car and cut off my angle - he's in the middle of the intersection at this point. He then gets out of his car, comes to my car, and starts yelling at me to get out of the car and slamming my windows and mirror. While he is doing this, he also calls me various slurs and insults. I tried recording this with my phone, but I recorded too late and didn't get any of the violent striking of my car, just a few insults. Still, it was pretty traumatizing for me as I had never had this happen to me before, and I was scared he would try to physically attack me. 

Only upon rewatching it at home did I realize he said something weird at the end. ***He said ""I saw you hit those people back there you shithead""*** before going back into his car and driving off (and running the red light).

This scared me, as I am almost 100% sure I did not hit anyone, but it has me doubting myself. There were no pedestrians on the street, I was the first car turning right and the road ahead of me was pretty empty. As mentioned above, I also have an excellent driving record. I don't drive reckless and I never hit anyone or anything before. But this has got me a little scared that maybe I *did* hit someone? I would imagine that even if I didn't see anyone, surely I would have felt my car making contact with someone or something.

**My questions:** what means do I have to report this incident? Given that I wasn't able to record when he actually hit my vehicle, and only have a portion where he makes a serious accusation against me, is it even worth pursuing any legal action? I know the streets where this happened, should I try to see if I can get any footage from the street cameras if that's possible? Do I need to get a lawyer in preparation if it turns out he was right and I somehow did hit someone?

I have lived in my apartment complex for 3 years with absolutely no issues whatsoever. I haven't even placed a maintenance request. My room is in a terrible location. It's on the first floor right next to a busy street. I sat down with the leasing manager several months before my renewal deadline and said I would not be renewing my lease unless I could move to a top floor apartment in a building away from the main road. They said they would love to work something out, and I coordinated with them for weeks to find the right spot. I have all the emails saved. Luckily, we found a place. I was very excited! I finalized the rent, confirmed the room, and even paid the first month of rent a couple months before my lease officially started and I could move in.

My Current Issue:

I decided to randomly check my resident portal two days ago, and I saw that my room number had changed. I thought it was a mistake somehow. I contacted the leasing office and they informed me that I would now be living in a first floor apartment again! I said this was unacceptable, because I had signed a lease for a different room! I contacted the manager and he said there was nothing else he could do, ""Based on the opinions of people higher up than him."" What!

The court is treating me as if I have access to the money equally but that is not the case as he has made finances inaccessible to me and thus, I have no lawyer (I’m a stay-at-home mother for over 20 years).

**According to the County’s Standing Order for children, property, and conduct of Parties:**

*6.1 We’re authorized to engage in acts reasonable &amp; necessary to the conduct of the party's usual business and occupation:* 

**1:** Does that include abrupt changes with auto-deposit from a joint account to an inaccessible one, removing me from our amazon account, and refusing to continue payment of auto insurance and/or rent which he has already been paying? 

 **In the same Standing Order:**

*3.14 Terminating or in any manner affecting the service of water, electricity, gas, telephone, cable television, or other contractual services, such as security, pest control, landscaping, or yard maintenance at the other party's residence or in any manner attempting to withdraw any deposits for service in connection with such services.*  
   
 **2:** My rent includes all utilities but for my phone--would this qualify as contempt of court should he terminate my rent payment (which he has already been paying)?

**AND**

*-5.3 Canceling, altering, or in any manner of affecting any casualty, automobile, or health insurance policies insuring the parties' property of persons including the parties' minor children:*   
  

**3:** On the day we signed these papers, he said that if I choose not to “work on the marriage” (which he did not define) then his paying this would be up to him. If he discontinued paying this, would he be in contempt of court that needs reporting?

**AND**

*-3.6: incurring any indebtedness, other than legal expenses in connection with this suit, except as specifically authorized by this order.\**  
 *-3.7: making withdrawals from any checking or savings account in any financial institution for any purpose, except as specifically authorized by this order\**  
 *-3.8: spending any sum of cash in either party's possession or subject to either party's control for any purpose, except as specifically authorized by this order.\**  
   
 **4:** Does this mean that we are both ordered to be transparent with our spending? The other party transfers large sums of money into inaccessible accounts from our joint account, and he has recently booted me from the Amazon account we had been using jointly. 

I don’t have a lawyer because I have no access to the money, and it’s possible he already spent it all on himself and his own lawyer, but I don’t know because he moved all the money to inaccessible accounts, prior to him appealing to the court. 

\*as specified by this order refers to 6: *To make expenditures and incur indebtedness for reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses in connection with this suit* AND *To make expenditures and incur indebtedness for reasonable and necessary living expenses for food, clothing, shelter, transportation, and medical care.*

  

**5:** The court requires that I set up AppClose for strict and monitored communication with the other party. I’ve reached out to both the District Clerk and Deputy District Clerk where I haven’t yet heard from one and the other advised I contact the other party’s attorney, respectively (it has been 6 days).

I, as well as my mother and my two siblings, have a family protective order against my father due to years of emotional abuse, with his ownership of multiple assault weapons and deteriorating mental health as contributing factors. We were granted an emergency protective order in 2019 when he was arrested for a separate issue, as we could not get one earlier as he was on the run with no known address. The biggest nail in his coffin in terms of the protective order was an emailed manifesto he sent to the governor of our state, as well as to my high school principal and my sisters middle school principal where he alleged that he could not go to jail because the government had been ending agents to harm him, myself, and my siblings, that the trump administration was feeding lies to my family to make us hate him, that he wanted to set the record straight, etc. 

After the emergency protective order was issued, it was granted/extended in an actual court hearing held later on, which my mom attended. I could not be there, nor my siblings, as we were all underage at the time. My father actually, insanely, requested that the restraining order be granted, but asked to be allowed to contact us via email. The judge agreed, and the official provision is that he is allowed to initiate one email to myself and my siblings per week, but cannot send any more unless we answer. Since then, he has sent multiple emails per week. None of us ever answer, but he sends anywhere between 2-4 a week. 

Today, I went to file a formal criminal complaint against him for doing so. I live in Virginia, and I have had to file a complaint against him before, so I followed the same procedure. The order expires in December, and I’m the only one who can testify against him at the renewal trial, as my siblings are minors and he hasn’t tried to contact my mother at all. I went to my local magistrate’s office, which I have never liked doing because I’ve always found them to be very intimidating and rude. However, it has never been as bad as today. The woman asked me why I’ve been “allowing” him to email me and told me she could not file my complaint due to him not having a current address. 

I just feel defeated. This man was so horrible to me and the only reason I haven’t blocked his emails is because he has a history of communicating his goals/whereabouts and if he has another complete breakdown like the one that he was having when arrested, I want to be able to anticipate it and possibly report it if I feel in danger. Technically I’m now an adult but this is all terrifying and overwhelming. 

The legal advice I’m asking for is: if I allow the order to expire instead of scheduling another court date, would it reflect poorly against me in the future if I tried to get another order?

This morning I woke up to a loud sound outside. Outside my window was a sight that filled me with instant rage. The front end of my husband's car was smashed in by pieces of tree.

We've lived here about 4 years, there are only a few apartments, and they were sold to our new landlord about 2.5 to 3 years ago. I've always liked the new landlord, but I was unaware (due 100% to the fact that I'm not observant) that there is a massive tree on the edge of the forest line (but on the property) that has been long dead. All other tenants including my husband were aware and it's been brought up with the new LL a few times since. 

I could tell immediately that the car was totaled. It's an older Toyota that had TONS of life left in it. In fact, we just bought new tires for it last week. The problem is that it's technical value is only about $1,400 to $2,200. We have full coverage and owe about $1600 on it, plus $250 deductible. 

I got ahold of my landlord, who replied that they would have someone come clear up the debris from the tree ASAP and asked if my insurance company had taken the car yet. I'll paraphrase from here.

I told LL that my insurance company advised me to have them contact their homeowner's insurance first, and I asked for their information so I could give it to my auto insurance company. 

LL replied that there is a section of my lease that absolves them of liability, so their insurance will be taking a close look at that. I looked. In a section marked ""parking"" it says ""In no event shall the landlord be liable for any damage or loss to tennant's vehicles or to any personal property contained on the premises."" 

Me: I understand, this was caused by the tree the neighbors have been telling you about because it's been dead for a long time now.

LL: Interesting. I had a tree guy come out last year who removed any trees that were in danger of damage last year. I'll have to contact my lawyer first. I don't want my insurance agent contacted until  my lawyer says it's necessary.

I ask around and this tree was dead before we even moved in. The ""tree guy"" from last year quoted the current LL $5,000 to remove it, and other tenants have bitched between themselves about how it's going to kill someone when it falls on one of the houses. 

I'll spare the rest of the details, but LL obviously intends to shirk responsibility. I realize the difference between them being liable and us taking the hit is only $250, but we can not afford to replace this car. We need both cars for both of us to work. So, we'll now likely be out some $$ because insurance will likely pay less than we owe after deductible. We've lost the value of a car with zero issues and lots of life left, and we're down 1 income, as now one of us will be unable to work. 

I find it hard to believe that LL would not be liable for damage caused by a tree that LL was negligent in removing. We're still in danger because most of that tree is still standing. LL won't answer calls from my insurance company to give them the necessary information. 

I would prefer to stay on good terms because we love it here and would like to stay for a long long time, but..

If taken to small claims court, what all could LL possibly be liable for? The deductible and reimbursement to my insurance company only? Or loss of income, loss of personal value, new tires, registration that was paid 16 days ago, some other compensation for being so negligent?

TL;DR: My landlord is pretending they never knew about a massive tree that was dead when they purchased the property and that they had a removal quote for last year. We can't replace totaled vehicle and I will be unable to work for the foreseeable future. What could we possibly go after LL for in or out of small claims court?",legaladvice,Car totaled due to landlord negligence.

Not unheard of. Jobs ask for that all of the time. So, the day comes and I, of course, make sure I have my SS card with me. Since it was my first day, I didn't have a locker or a lock (and I stupidly didn't think of that beforehand). My new manager offered her cabinet, where she also keeps her belongings, to put my purse (with my SS card in it) while she trains me. 

Long story short - my SS card was gone by the end of the night. I obviously made it known to my new manager that it was gone, but she didn't seem very concerned. Which I get - we're still strangers, it's not her problem, has no effect on her whatsoever, etc., but come on. So, I didn't get any help from her retracing my steps, asking the other employees, etc., and now my SS card is obviously out in the world somewhere. 

I have since run my credit with the 3 top credit reporters (found nothing suspicious) and changed all of my passwords. I also put a fraud alert on all of my accounts to watch for any suspicious activity that will last a year. The only thing that has happened since losing my card is receiving two pieces of mail from Visa and Spectrum in a language that I don't speak or read. Not sure if it's related &amp; someone is trying to open accounts for those places in that language or just pure coincidence? 

From what I've read on the internet so far, it doesn't sound like I can do much more unless I can gather an adequate amount of evidence that my SS# is being used by someone else. So, with all of that, I'm here hoping someone has some better information or advice on what to do next!

I was wondering if I need to lawyer up in this situation.
Long story short, I was in a vehicle accident last week. Other party was at fault. When he told his boss about the accident, he switched up the story. We didn’t get a police at the scene of the accident since it was minor and party agreed to pay for damages (big mistake). His company offered to pay a certain price but my insurance agent said it was too low and it was just an estimate price. Company got pissed and said to file a claim.
After the accident, I was having trouble getting the other party’s insurance information. Contacted his job, they refuse to give it to me. I posted on Facebook seeking advice from insurance agents. I did not say anything bad about company nor named them, even though people were asking to name drop.
I deleted the post the next day when I contacted my insurance agent. I informed him of the post and deleted it.
Company found out and is “seeking legal advice” because apparently I slandered his company and the public people are aware.
Funny thing, he told my Insurance agent if he went along with the claim, he was going to seek legal advice about the post. 
Obviously the man is trying to scare us so we won’t submit the claim, but we did.
My question is, he keeps calling me agent trying to scare us off. Is there anything I can do about it? Should I get a lawyer?
Also, they’re also lying about witnesses. At the scene of the accident, there was only 2 witnesses, which are named on the claim report and police report.

Eventually, they could barely walk and were using their sick time as fast as they could accrue it, and were in and out of the ER for pain management, eventually being transported via ambulance to a larger hospital for an emergency spinal consult and operated on.

After two weeks of initial recovery they were told they were recovering nicely but could not bend their back for another month. They worked at a desk job and were comfortable sitting, which was permitted, so they asked to be allowed to return to work. The employer asked to delay their return, and told them to fill out FMLA paperwork in the meantime.

The employer then messaged them to say they were being terminated, stating they were not satisfied with their performance as of ~8 weeks ago, ~4 weeks before the surgery. They do not recall any complaints being made or corrective action being requested at the time. They were given some new responsibilities at that time and told the employer it would take some time to learn them, and then did so. Things were fine, to their knowledge, for the next weeks leading up to the ER visits and surgery. The email also stated that patients at clinic remarked how much less chaotic things had been in the last ~4 weeks.

From my understanding, they were an employee-at-will, and there is not much recourse for them in terms of legal action or filing a complaint with that state so it will be known that the employer treats people this way.

I rear ended her but would I still be counted as being at fault? She has money and good standing in the community so I need to be prepared to fight this.

My question is- I’m originally from PA, he’s from IL. We both have our own PA and IL licenses, registrations, etc. ( these are our permanent family homes). 

But now since we moved here for a few years, am I supposed to get a residency for Michigan? If I work here, do I pay taxes here if I’m not a resident? I’m so confused, please help. I’m not very smart with taxes and government info but I’m trying to understand.

I also applied for food stamps until I find a job (pray for me).

They did a crap job that has now resulted in black mold and need for massive repairs. What can I expect from mediation and is it worth contacting my homeowner's insurance company?


Located in Michigan.

April 2018, I hired a fully licensed, insured, professional company to do a complete roof replacement on my house. This included a full tear down, replacement of decking in spots, removing the can vents and old vent system, installing a ridge vent, and the actual new roof.

Yesterday, I noticed a large water stain on my daughter's bedroom ceiling. My husband looked at it and pointed out it was still wet. Active leak somewhere.

Today, I have had 2 different contractors come out to give me free inspections/quotes on fixing the roof and the damage. Both have pointed out the exact same issues:
Powered louver on roof should have been removed and the spot roofed over. This is where the water is leaking. The original roofer covered one side of it with fiberglass tape and roofing tar for. . .reasons? The leaking has created black mold in my attic crawlspace.

Roof is not venting properly. When they put in the ridge vent, they did not check the soffit and the insulation is so tight against it it is constricting airflow.

There are several spots of just plain badly done work that I won't go into detail on.

I am currently waiting on the official quotes from these two contractors.

Now, with the original roof, I have a lifetime warranty on materials and labor with the company. My ideal solution would be for them to come out, fix their mistakes, AND fix the interior damage, PLUS pay for a licensed mold removal company to come out and clean the attic, then give me a sizable refund on the cost of my roof (I realize that last part is pure wishful thinking).  Part of our contract is that any disputes need to go through a specific mediator before court.

Before I contact the company, I was wondering if a) anyone had advice on how to address/go about the mediation if it ends up having to go that far? And b) would it be worth contacting my homeowner's insurance company and let my insurance just fight it out with their insurance?

Ford calls us saying that they believe the previous shop turned the engine counter clockwise, throwing off the timing and causing immense damage to the valves/pistons in the engine. They said the damage is so severe that the engine needs to be replaced, with a price tag of $10,206 that was just sent to our email about 15 min ago.

Sorry if this is a low level post--I (24 F) received my first speeding ticket and have been trying to do my fair share of googling but have come up with subpar information on how I might be able to get my speeding ticket of over 20mph on the highway in California reduced/dismissed. I was apparently going 85mph on a 65mph--definitely should have been more aware but sometimes when you're matching speed on the left lane you go a little faster than you realize. Also my car is red :'(. Has anyone had any luck in doing so, and if so, how did you go about doing it?

&amp;#x200B;

The current options I think I have are to:

a) extend my date and schedule a court hearing, and hope that the officer doesn't show up since I changed the initial date (I'm not sure if this is actually true, that if the officer is a no-show the charge is dismissed).

b) Do a trial by declaration in hopes that the officer doesn't write a statement, but this seems like an unhelpful option.

c) Request online for a fee reduction after guilt admission but the reduction is not substantial, and not guaranteed.

I will definitely be attending traffic school to keep the points off my record, but simply attending school will not reduce my fine.

Additionally I have made my own family of non-blood relatives from friends who have cared more about me over the years than my own family did and I wouldn't want them barred from attending my service because of shitty decisions from my relatives. Would it be possible to add something to a will forcibly allowing them to be in attendance despite what my blood family might say?

The house was sold and instead of it going into a trust account, the proceeds were split and put into their personal accounts. After the money was deposited, my uncle ran off and refused to settle matters and distribute the funds to any beneficiaries.

In response (after a lot of yelling from the judge) placed ordered the court to place a lien for the amount he took on that property. When talking to a Nevada attorney on the matter, we were told that the judge has no jurisdiction to place a lien on a Nevada property. He suggested we open up a probate in case in Nevada to get the lien placed. Is this accurate? Is there another way to get the lien placed on the Nevada property?

So the situation is my brother has had the police called on him 20 times to request a 5150 related to his mental condition by Mom in the past.

Everytime she calls and tells them what's happening, the police say he doesn't fit the criteria for mental hold 

1,2)danger to others or self
3) gravely disabled

So she acted like he had hit her in this latest episode 
That was December.

He was having an episode slurring his words and burning toast by mistake and may have said some words that deemed him a danger to others, but the police said

""We are reluctant to deal with mental patients because 50% of the time with schizophrenia we deploy tasers or deadly force, then it becomes an issue with the city"" 

When I went to unplug the toaster he got startled and hit my hand out of the way (his brother) and was acting bizarre slurring his words and doing a drug walk

My mom called the cops. I declined to press simple battery charges for the hand, it wasn't really a battery , it was just brothers , however as soon as I declined , the police ran to my mom looking to press charges on her behalf. She felt pressured to come up with something that would get him hospitalized but she just doesn't understand that they interpreted it terribly.

She figured they were going to 5150 him and embellished the story of how he's a ""danger to others"" but it went beyond that and the cops said my mom is 66 years old and it's a crime. 

Criminal threats, elder abuse, probation no force violation, plus 7 enhancements from previous records totalling 10 felonies.


They wanted to push for a deal that would require mental hospital for 2 years plus time served 
But he is declining wanting to go to court because she will testify in his defense (public defender only)


The attorney has said they may try and ""impeach"" my moms testimony that she made it all up and was never even injured or scared, in belief that the family is just protecting her son. In other words, that she'd be ""lying about having lied"" 

Should he wait for a deal?

Several requests for dismissal haven't had an effect
with the DA

The Ventura County DA doesn't seem to have any desire to charge the correct crime (either police coercing her to file false claims or my Mom filing a false police report)

It's been 10 months and unfortunately this would qualify as 3rd strike. 

He is more than willing to recieve mental treatment now, but not anything court ordered

My partner's mother has been harassing us (mostly him) for the last roughly 10 months. She lives out of state in South Dakota and we're in Arizona. All forms of communication have been blocked but messages such as emails and voicemails will still go through to him and she's been pretty crafty about finding new ways to contact us in the past. The context of these is not physically threatening or violent in nature but it is deliberately inflammatory and it's very clear that shes trying to provoke a negative reaction out of us. It's not always directly insulting, but it can be. She does not know our current address, but may have an idea of where we work. This has also been steadily worsening for some time, as events that she recounts in her messages are becoming further from reality and she's becoming more desperate for a response.  Neither of us have responded to her since I directly told her to stop contacting me via text in December 2020. Since then, she has not directly contacted me but has addressed one letter (sent to a former address) and a few emails (sent to my partner-she does not have my email address) to both of us. 

I'm not really sure if any additional context would help but let me know if more information is needed. I would really appreciate any advice on what we should do from here or if this warrants a no contact order (also sorry if I'm labeling that wrong, haven't really been in this position before). Past attempts to reason with her about her behavior have worsened the situation as she is highly manipulative. I'm not sure if she would do anything beyond her current actions, but as this has been worsening over time I would put it past her either. I ultimately just want this to stop and for her to leave us alone. I know it effects my partner and it definitely infuriates me.

First off, he broke lease before I even moved in. I had done a walkthrough with my leasing agent before my lease start, where he took pictures of repairs that needed to be done before I moved in. Date of moving in, none of them had been done, including mowing the lawn, which was stated in the lease that it would be mowed before I moved in. He credited me $50 on my rent to make up for it. 

Also regarding the lawn, I received a letter from the city about how my lawn was in violation of a municipal code, which included a fine charged directly to the property tax (so directly to him) and it needed to be fixed within 10 days or pay a fine of $500 and possible jail time. As I read I realized the date was for an entire month before my lease even began, meaning when the property was entirely under my landlords name he was breaking local ordinances. 

The last tenants also left garbage and broken outdoor items outside in the driveway which I now have to pay to get taken away. 

Also after moving in I realized all but one of my windows is broken. One didn't open at all, and every other has broken valances so once you get it open it just slams back down with all the weight of the window. Theres a screw under one window holding it up so obviously someone knew it was an issue. I submitted a maintenence report 3 weeks ago, and almost 2 weeks ago I had a window company do an estimate, and have not heard back since. I've tried to contact both the company and my landlord and both say they can't get a hold of the other. What struck me though was while the contractor was doing his inspection he said it was a major fire hazard, as I wouldn't be able to use any of the windows as a means of escape if needed. 

Is there anything I can do here? I'm thinking of contacting the fire department about the windows being a hazard, but beyond that I'm not sure what to do.

She was a good student in high school and we were out of touch for many years. I actually hadn't talked to her since 2007. She messaged me on FB, I was divorced recently and a bit lonely so we talked a lot and hit it off. We met up, went on some dates, and I saw nothing wrong. She said she was unemployed due to COVID / making more on unemployment than she made while working her normal job which she claimed was nursing (turns out she lied, not a nurse). Not my favorite answer to ""why don't you work?"" but like I said I was lonely and she's a gorgeous, nice lady who I knew from high school as a good student (she was in the top 10 of our class). 

She asked tons of questions about what I do, how much I make (never actually told her that amount) and just in general but always under the guise of interest in my field and not prying for money. I started to get weary about 2 months into ""dating"" her when she seemed to have an obsession with LSD, namely, shrooms, and kept practically begging me to go hiking with her on shrooms. I denied 100% as I'm not into that, and it doesn't seem safe to me. Especially since I'd never done that and never plan to. 

So, 2 months in she tells me she's pregnant (after telling me she was on birth control, but that was a lie I'm about 99% sure). We ended up breaking things off amicably somehow, and she told me we could just discuss custody / child support when the due date is closer. Here's the real kicker. About a month after announcing the pregnancy she was trying to move in with her mother (she was living with her father ""between jobs""). Her mother, I guess, didn't realize she'd been lying to me the whole time, and while the three of us were at dinner the mother told her that ""she can't live with her, because the landlord won't allow a person with a record on the lease."" This was super awkward and I pretended I knew. I confronted her about it after. She wouldn't give me ANY information about what she was arrested for and said it was bullshit / she was just unlucky. So I looked into it on google and her name came up easily enough (not if you just search her name, you had to specifically target criminal records around the surrounding counties, then hit the right one to find it off google search). ""BI/INJURY TO A CHILD"" and ""BI/BURGLARY HABITATION W/INTENT TO COMMIT OTHER FELONY"". 

My question is this.. she posed the custody / child support stuff earlier presuming I'd be paying her child support, and she'd have full custody, but knowing this I plan to fight as hard as I can. Do I have a chance in hell at securing FULL custody of this child given her record? I'm not even interested in the child support that she clearly wouldn't be able to pay me anyways, but she's intent on keeping the child and I am not up for sharing custody with a potentially violent criminal.

I filed a complaint with my state's consumer protection board. I'm now in communication with the auto dealership, they are trying to get the hard inquiries removed from my credit. 

The company director asked what else can he do to help me feel better about this situation. I'm not really sure what to ask for. He stated he will speak with the sales manager who lied / committed the fraud, he won't lose his job though.

We took over the empty rooms of the house, the only room shared was the kitchen. We had our own living room, dining room/playroom, bathroom, and 2 bedrooms, and the outside patio. We also, as a family of 3, came with things that needed to be stored, which we used the utility room and she'd for. GIL had nothing in these areas at all, except for a dining room table that was never used, end tables, and a desk, and GIL expressed to us multiple times our use of these spaces was absolutely okay.

After 3 years, due to growing tensions in the family and my husband's desperate need to cut them off for reasons way too long for this post, we were finally able to save up enough to buy a house. During the house search, it was  discussed that there was absolutely no time frame or expectation of when we'd be out, and in fact, we were told several times there was no rush. 

During the first week of our move, we discussed multiple times with my GIL, and her children, that we wished to move out slowly over the course of a month, because my husband works two jobs 12 hours a day, and could only take off 1 week to do all the big stuff with the moving truck. The trust issues run so deep with this family for us, that we told them multiple times we did not want their help and asked them not to touch our things. My MIL has twice overstepped major boundaries in the past with entering our spaces and cleaning when we've specifically asked her not too, including one time when we lived in our own apartment and we went out of town and asked her to feed our cat. We came home to our space violated, our stuff rearranged and things thrown away because she ""was trying to help"". And then she did it again when I gave birth to our son in September. 

My husband returned to work on the 2nd, and because I'm a stay at home mom with 2 kids, we couldn't go back to the house during the day, and instead my husband made trips every night after he got off his second job to grab more stuff. That week, his family entered my GIL house, and began ""helping"" again. They removed my houseplants and put them outside, which caused major damage to them, and they also went outside and took every single potted plant I had that I grew from seed and dumped them behind the shed. The damage to the plants alone is into the hundreds. They took one of my daughter's American Girl dolls and put it outside next to the trash, along with other miscellaneous stuff we hadn't gotten yet. My husband's uncle came and cleaned out my GILs car that we had been using, and left everything, including paperwork and other important items, and put them in open containers out in the rain. 

After that, we expressed our anger and outrage that they'd go in and do that to us and our things especially when we specifically asked them not to, and it was met with complete and total hostility, to the point where we now believe that they will go back over and throw our things in the trash out of spite. 

Because my husband is working and can no longer call off because his vacation is used, we cannot go over and get everything that is left all at once until this Sunday. He stopped over again last night to grab more, and he will stop every night this week.

I noticed that the amount included in the signed lease was significantly less than the amount I actually paid during that timeframe. I went to the leasing office and they agreed I paid approx. $300 more each month for rent than I should have during that time, however because they just sold the property to new owners and hired new property managers, the people currently there really had nothing to do with the overcharges and therefore couldn't really help me. They told me to reach out to the old property manager, which I did, but I am assuming they either won't get back to me, or will tell me it's not their problem since they're no longer associated with the property. 

Do I have any legal recourse here? Who would even be responsible for paying me back in this scenario? The old property managers likely will say they paid it to the old owner (which I don't even know who that is), and the new managers/owners are saying it wasn't paid to them so they can't help. The total amount I overpaid is about $4,500 so probably not worth trying to go to small claims court over given the expenses of doing so will be more than that, but it's still a lot of money to me so if there's any chance at getting it back I'd like to try.

The tree died pretty quickly, and it looks like it’s going to fall down at any moment now, endangering the lives/safety/property of everyone including our neighbors. It has to go before winter, and I’m worried that our landlord will charge us for the cost. 

I know the answer is typically a resounding “no, tenants are not responsible for the costs of removing a tree” — but I’m worried that we might be fucked because of this clause in our lease:
 
“Tenants will maintain all care of yard, including but not limited to mowing, watering lawns, litter control, removing snow and ice from sidewalks and other general yard care requirements.  Lawns and leaves must be raked and disposed of by tenants.  If this duty is not performed by the Tenants, the Landlord will have it done and charge tenants for the cost.”
 
Can our landlord make the case that taking care of the weed in the spring was part of the “general yard care requirements” and therefore, due to our negligence of the problem, hold us responsible for the cost of getting the tree removed?

He came out today and found openings in the extremities of our house where joists were exposed. These holes are part of the construction of the house and not caused by damage.

There was also evidence of mice. None of these openings were noted in our home inspection and now to fix this issue we have to pay a hefty sum to have the perimeter of the house flashed.

I've been living in my apartment for about 10 months now. It's a 2 bedroom unit with each bedroom having it's own bathroom. About 2 months ago, we began suffering from 2 smelly issues.

1. Our AC unit's drain is hooked up to the plumbing beneath my bathroom's sink. Unfortunately, the drain was hooked up to the wrong side of the trap so the AC unit had free access to suck sewage air up through it's drain and spit it out into our rooms. This was identified and fixed within a few weeks.

2. Around the same time that the above issue was fixed, I started noticing awful smells coming from beneath my sink, seemingly at random times through out the day. 80% of the day the bathroom smells fine, but every so often awful smells would start bleeding out of the cabinet beneath the sink. After a month of these smells, apartment management cutting open walls and finding nothing, flushing out the traps, looking for moisture/leaks, we are still no sooner to solving where the smell is coming from. As of lately I've come to the conclusion that these smells seem to occur roughly 10-15 minutes after my housemate uses the restroom, or 10-15 minutes after we hear the upstairs unit using their plumbing. I've been trying to communicate this recent theory of the cause of the smell with management, but since our last attempt to figure out where the smell is coming from failed, management has not replied to me at all


It's been nearly 2 months now since I've been able to go more than two days in my apartment without having to vacate my room to escape an awful smell. Often it happens while I'm asleep and I'm awoken to a sewage odor and need to move to the living room to sleep. There are days that if you open the cabinet beneath my sink that you'll gag. At first the apartment management were responsive, but dragged their feet fixing things (it was hard to get them out there the exact time the smells were happening, I suspect they didn't believe it was happening at first). Now that we've tried and failed a few times, even though they've experienced the smell now (was able to get one out at 8pm) they've become unresponsive. I'm sick of fighting a losing battle against the smell of sewage.


Do I have to deal with this? 

Are bad smells solid enough grounds for me to demand alternative accommodations? 

Due to the length of time that we've been dealing with this, could we say that we're being withheld from peaceful enjoyment of our residence, even if it's a smell?

The dental office told me they'd have it sent back to insurance, and I had no need to worry since I was already paying on the credit we had set up.

 Fast forward to February, 2021, I recieved another bill, only this time, the bill was for $340, again, listing for the same services I had already agreed to pay for. The amounts for what I was told I would pay back in August, and what insurance was supposed to pay, had drastically changed. Again, called dental company, that again, confused by what happened, said they'd send it back to insurance to have dealt with. 

Come June, 2021, I've paid off my credit I owed the dental company. I now have a bill for the exact same services at the amount of $505, which insurance is now covering even less of. I called the dental office, and this time, I was told management would look into, and keep me informed. Sent it to my insurance provider. Now, as of yesterday of this post, I get a final notice of fees to the tune of the $505. I finally call my insurance company, wondering what's going on, and why my insurance keeps declining covering the costs, and from what insurance told me, is that the service I recieved required a few criterias for insurance to cover the service to the extent they were supposed to, and some of the services performed during my visits were not covered under what the payment plan was set up for. My insurance mentioned not wanting to ""throw the dental company under the bus,"" but they believe that the services that weren't covered were neglected to be mentioned.

 I still have all the original documents of what was supposed to be covered under insurance, but it's seeming like now that the dental company massively dropped the ball. Is there anything I can do to get the dental company to come to a compromise on this whole situation? If any more details are needed about the situation, I'll provide whatever I can.",legaladvice,Dental insurance keeps declining covering a service I already paid for after insurance; possible negligence of not communicating service from dental company.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p697cf/dental_insurance_keeps_declining_covering_a/

I’ve posted in here before, and I have gotten those questions answered. I’m here today for this reason: my roommate has an unauthorized pet (we are on separate leases, so it’s her problem), and our apartment complex’s pet policy states that there will be a fine of $250/day. I met with my property manager, and it seems like he is somewhat trying to be lenient because she said she had an emotional support animal but hasn’t provided documentation in 3 weeks, but she has had this pet for a couple of months. On the other hand, it also seemed like he didn’t understand the pet policy in the lease because he seemed shocked. After our meeting, I had seen the other part of the pet policy further down. It says this that at the landlord’s discretion, they can declare the lease in default. What exactly is a defaulted lease? Is that similar to an eviction?

She used to live in California and bought a car with a financier that is holding the title.

I met her when she moved back to Michigan and separated from her ex. She is still making payments on the car and because California is a title holding state she will need to apply for FOREIGN OWNERSHIP-REGISTRATION ONLY registration in Michigan.

For context, my friends and I took a really fun trip to California together in Lancaster, an hour and a half from LA. We stayed in a bnb for the week and had a great time.

When we arrived, we noticed that on of the doors on the bedrooms had a dent in it on the outside, and some wood putty on the inside. We thought it was peculiar, but didn't say anything to the host because we didn't want to be rude, and it simply wasn't an issue we had even perceived.

Fast forward to a day after the trip is done and over, and I receive a message from the host claiming that said damage was not there when she last inspected the place, and that she always goes through and records the place after every inspection and she just knows that wasn't there. I explain to her that it was simply there when we arrived, and we didn't make to much note of it. She claims she will invoice me for the damages, in which I refuse because no damage had been done by either my party nor I.

She backs down initially from the claim, and I sit confused wondering if she's actively trying to scam me or if it's just some crazy misunderstanding. The next day I receive an email notification from AirBnB notifying me of a previous host requesting compensation for damages caused by me on my stay, in which I immediately refute again, claiming the same thing I had before: The host is lying, the door was damaged upon arrival.

After this, I had a representative reach out to me on behalf of AirBnB through email, in which I had to explain the same thing a third time. Come this morning and I receive a response to what I had sent to the representative over email, stating that after reviewing the stories and evidence from both sides, she believes I should compensate my host for ""damages I caused.""

I mean to simply put it, it's outrageous. Neither my friends nor I had caused those ""damages,"" and I have no idea what kind of ""evidence"" the host could claim to have or have shown to the representative, but I now I have an outstanding balance on my account claiming I need to pay.

I had sent a response email back, but now I just have to wait. Realistically, what do I do now? Is there any way I can refute this further? What should I expect?

It was a professionally-manufactured trailer, and has the VIN plate still on it.

The amount of work involved to get this trailer road-worthy involves replacing all the wiring for the lights and installing new lights, replacing the tires, re-packing the bearings and hubs, removing and replacing the entire deck, replacing the fenders, adding rails, and replacing the springs— and maybe some more stuff that he doesn’t know about yet.  Basically, the only decent part of the trailer is the frame itself.

Given the amount of work involved in getting it into usable shape, he is considering removing the manufacturer’s plate and trying to title the trailer as a self-built one (and going to a third-party DMV vendor to do it), rather than trying to get an “abandoned” title.

I leased a small warehouse back in 2016 in Walnut, CA, the lease was only for a year, but both the landlord and I forgot that it was only for a year, after the contract expired, they didn't ask me to renew, I kept paying the rent and the landlord kept accepting the payment, so I guess we were just doing ""month-to-month"" leases.

In 2018, my landlord sold the whole complex (including my unit) to a real estate investor company,  the new company took over, however, they didn't raise the rent nor asked me to sign a new contract, so again, I kept paying the original rent and they kept accepting my payment, no problem at all.

In 2021, they suddenly tried to raise the rent by 50%, I figured out that it would not be a reasonable price, and I needed a bigger warehouse anyways, so I found a new place and moved out. On the day of handing back the key, the property manager told me that he would send my back the security deposit ASAP, I emailed him the address to send back the deposit and thanked him.

Now, it has been more than 4 months, I have email/call/contacted the new landlord and property company multiple times but got ZERO response. My business really needed the cash, I had no choice but to bring them to small claim court. The claim amount is $2,800 (I put down 2 months of security deposit, $1400\*2), I had a sheriff to help me to serve the claim, which he did, and the court date in on Sept 7th. 

I am a little nervous because this is my first time bring someone to small claim court, the fact that the landlord and the property manager did not even try to negotiate or contact me makes me nervous. Do they have any hidden ace on hand that I don't know of? What can they possibly do to persuade the judge? Any advice on how to prepare for this case?

I do not know if this matters, my business is really simple, we just bring in products (they are usually palletized) and store them in the warehouse, when a client orders, we just ship them, so there is really no damage in the warehouse apart from the normal wear. I am willing to pay any repairs if they can send me a receipt or anything, but they just straight ignore all my emails. Oh, and the owner company is a pretty large Asian food importer here in California, the guy just bought the whole industrial complex for his children, they are so rich that it usually takes them 10-15 days to cash out our rents. I am not sure that they are too rich to care about the security deposit or they are going to fight back.

My child suffered a 100% preventable birth injury caused by an incompetent Dr. He spent 2 months in the NICU and his out come was first, very bleak, then unknown, and now miraculously, good.

Infact he's doing great, all things considered, and is only mildly delayed. I don't want to go into too much detail because his case WAS accepted by a lawyer.

He's 15 months now, he goes to physical therapy because 1 of his legs isn't used as much as the other and is still not verbal, but does make tons of noises just no words yet. I feel blessed he can eat on his own, cruise-walk (even if it is a little wonky), and otherwise seems pretty normal.

That being said he still has monthly neurology, pediatric, and physical therapy appointments. I couldn't go back to work because what (office) job is gonna be OK with me missing 4 days a month, every month? My job title is not available for ""part time"" that I can find. And unfortunately, my last job was completely unwilling to work with me. I'm probably going to have to take a crazy 50% pay cut and get a part time job eventually. I am lucky my husband has a good job.

Naturally, we were all stressed by this. He was born during covid and I have had to venture into every covid ridden hospital in my city numerous times because of this. Only I can go, because, due to covid only one ""visitor"" is allowed at a time, so my husband doesn't go. 

It's been a nightmare. I have a 7 year old as well and we have has 0 medical problems and only take her for routine visits once a year and dentist etc.

Today our lawyer (a very famous one) called and said after a meeting with his team they will no longer be moving forward because my son's injuries are not ""significant"" and that he has 18 years to continue his case, should more ""serious"" problems crop up.

The lawyer flat out refused to consider suing on behalf of myself for emotional distress, saying it was too hard to prove.

I've got $800 in extra neurology bills not covered by insurance, no job, and I go to thearpy and take medication for anxiety! 

And trust me when I say this was 100% preventable. Think physical like 'the doctor dropping the baby on the floor during birth' or 'the doctor smashing the babies head against the metal table right after birth' (I'm changing some details but the gist is the exactly the same)

The lawyer acknowledged that but said it was the ""outcome"" that is the reason we're not pursuing it.

Should I press to sue on behalf of my son or wait? Do I, personally, have a case? 

I think I will wait to pursue a case for my son, if he needs special schooling, or special medical devices for school, I would like a fund set up for him. He didn't deserve some moron ruining his life right out of the gate because 'ooppsy!' And I mourn for the life he (and we) should be having (happy, healthy baby).

A few weeks ago I fell while rock climbing and fractured a vertebrae. I went to the ER because it was 11pm and nothing else was open. In the ER I was worried about cost, but they told me that the state of Texas has a law that all emergency visits need to be handled by your insurance company as in network. I just went to the closest place because it was my back! I didn't know if I would be paralyzed if I waited, and I was in a lot of pain. 

My employer is based out of the state of California, though, which I do not believe has the same law that all emergency room visits need to be treated as in network. My insurance company, Blue Shield of California, is charging me upwards of $4k because the emergency room I went to was out of network. The cost isn't even going towards my deductible, which is only $750, it is going towards my out of pocket cost so I will need to pay the full bill. My fault I guess for not knowing that fracturing a vertebrae would cost me thousands of dollars. 

My question is, because the injury happened in Texas, are they beholden to follow Texas laws? Or are they not because they are based out of California.

About a year ago a guy came to our apartment block and signed a bunch of tenants up for a rent strike. He promised to offer advice and assistance on the topic.

He told us that a rent strike was sort of like when workers go on strike, except instead of workers not getting paid - the landlord doesn't get paid.

The first ten months or so have been great. I've been able to save up money for a deposit on a house and actually live like a human being. The guy who organised the strike gave us petitions and posters and leaflets to put on walls.

However, the landlord has been sending demands for the rent, and I'm beginning to worry he doesn't understand how a rent strike works. I tried speaking to the guy who organised our rent strike, but he has disappeared and his number is no longer connected.

I don't owe this money, do I?


I've transferred my deposit that I saved into my brother's bank account to keep it safe until I get an answer.

1.providing little to no update on when our shipment would arrive 
2.shipment arriving 3 weeks late 
3.intentionally getting ignored and/or hung up on when attempting to get in contact with management
4.charging us a $350 fee that we had previously made arrangements for that fee not to be added 
5. Horrible customer service and damage to our items

Initially, I simply wanted a refund for a fee that they should not have charged us, but now I wanted to weigh all my options. 

The only issue on my end, is before they loaded our stuff into their moving truck, they found a couple 1/8s of cannabis in one of our boxes. They called us, set the cannabis aside and we had a friend pick it up for us as we were already in Texas. 

Because this happened they are threading to contact the department of transportation for not even an ounce of cannabis unless we remove our negative reviews.

I knew said roommate for over 8 years, and was extremely hesitant on moving in with him for a previous roommate situation that ended sour, but no where near this level. It started innocent enough, he wanted to help me out since my parents aren't great people. They neglected to help me ever get a license, and I was desperate for an escape and a chance at a career, and finally becoming an adult.

 He's possessive, cynical, controlling, and has a very frail ego. These traits didn't show the first few months, but they had years ago and he swore he was different before I moved in. First thing that was off, he was dating a 19 year old co worker, and was very infatuated with the fact she's only dated toxic guys. 

When things started to really go downhill, he lost his job as a correction's officer, stopped working out, broke up and got back together with said girlfriend multiple times in three months. He made her delete all social media. 

Her and I were around eachother a lot, so we got along. He'd also straight up leave me at work and she'd remember me before him. I thought she was a little dimwitted and thought it was awkward he was dating someone so young. Obviously, you know where this is going. ""DiD yOu FuCk My RoOmMaTe"" the answer is no, but he's projecting, because he's slept with some of my ex's. 


What I didn't realize, there was a point she stopped being my friend, and forgot to inform me. She was dropping me off at work one night and I was telling her I planned on moving out because I don't like living with the roommate, and had no intentions of talking to him after the fact for his toxic behavior. 

She told said roommate that night and he started blowing up my phone while I was at work, saying ""why are you venting to MY girlfriend?"" He really likes the pronoun game. I simply said ""no worries, I'm moving out."" 


He threatened to break my arms and hospitalize me, left work early to go through my shit, threw the rest of it out, while I was at work. I didn't realize what he'd stolen until I had time to go through my stuff. I have the texts, bank statements, and footage of her dropping me off the night all of this happened, because I work at a very monitored place.

I wasn’t given proper notice or Union representation either. I think the latter part breached the Union contract. Is any of this unlawful? 

So I was fired from a museum (in San Diego, CA) on Friday for extremely petty reasons and with unjust cause. I worked there for four months last year until the pandemic caused the museum to close. I was put on furlough. And during the closure, the museum unionized. In May of this year, we reopened. I’ve worked there since and did a fantastic job, according to my coworkers and many members of upper management. Some others, however, seemed to take a disliking to me.

On Friday, I was suddenly called into the HR Director’s office without notice. She told me that I was being fired for using my phone on the museum floor the week prior, which isn’t explicitly prohibited in the employee handbook, and every one of my coworkers does the same thing. I was even sending something to the work chat when a step-in manager caught me and said it was not allowed. Several coworkers reacted or replied to that message within minutes. And apparently I took a 20m break vs. the 10 minutes we’re allowed a few weeks ago. This is technically allowed during the reopening period, and I definitely don’t make a habit of taking long breaks. Also, most of my coworkers do the same thing. 

Since the meeting was impromptu, I wasn’t given the opportunity to have Union reps present. They weren’t even aware that this was in the works. 

The whole firing caught me off guard. I hoarsely asked the HR woman and my (female) supervisor if I could go to the bathroom. They said it was fine. After crying on the floor of the single-stall restroom for less than five minutes, the HR lady unlocked the door, told me to stand up and act like an adult, and said I needed to leave the premises. 

That event was highly traumatizing. I keep having flashbacks to it. 

And also, the HR woman said the 90-day probationary period has been in effect since we reopened, so they could let me go for any reason. I should have seniority status since I’ve worked there closer to 7 months in total and definitely have over 90 days under my belt. 

If I have seniority status, I need to receive 3 written warnings for being terminated. I already received sick pay this year, which employees only get if they have seniority status. My only concern is that I started back in a new position upon our reopening. 

Anyway, on what grounds might I take legal action—for both unlawful firing and forced entry to the bathroom?",legaladvice,[CA] I was fired unfairly and perhaps unlawfully on several accounts.

Construction, he basically begged me to work for him (I was there to help my brother who was employed by him and he saw my work ethic and skill level) so I said I would. He had me work a few jobs that went absolutely terribly from the start. He’s an awful boss, knows nothing about construction and screws up every job by doing shit wrong, lying to clients, not supplying enough materials or the wrong tools, etc. He just decided he wanted to do what my dad did and started a business and has been running it into the ground ever since. 
Long story short he does not get repeat clients and never will. 
What happened to me is that my grandfather died and I was preparing to leave out of state to go back to his funeral the next day. He had been sick for about a week (very sick, whole family) and then came back to the jobsite with no mask on and still looking sick as a dog. He came right up to me. I backed away and said “please give me space I don’t want to get sick” and he started going on about how it wasn’t Covid and he got the blood test etc. I said I didn’t care if it was the flu, a cold, or whatever but I can’t afford to get sick because I don’t want to go home to my grandmother and get her sick just as my grandpa had died. He refused to back away, and kept walking toward me (backing me up into a corner) as he started to talk about how he wished the world was a horrible place like I thought it was and wished it was actually so homophobic and racist (I’m a liberal and he’s something else -wether it be libertarian or republican or just a crazy person with no real ties anywhere). He is very often racist and hateful during work because he thinks it’s funny to get a rise out of people. 
I told him I was uncomfortable, and he was creating an environment where his employee felt unsafe. He continued to come closer to me (at this point I’m in a corner of a bathroom I was grouting with no exit) and kept talking about how ridiculous my beliefs are and how stupid I am. I finally said “leave the room” and then finally “Get the FUCK out of this room” and he turned and left. 
I was extremely angry by the end of this and was fuming. I called my partner and my father and my brother who had been there and vented about it and told him that I would never work for him again, I would help my brother finish this job but I expect him not to be on the jobsite while I’m there and I don’t ever want to see his face again. I had accidentally grabbed my partners phone that day so I had to text my brother to relay that info (he had gone with him to a different jobsite) so I don’t know exactly how he responded but I assume it wasn’t well. The owners of the house heard the whole thing while I was on the phone and also hate the guy for the shitty job he’s been doing (but they like my brother and I)
He also has not paid me for 4 days of work over the last 6 months and yea I did sign a w4 and have the jobs I did recorded through texts with him what time I was there and when I left.

So last night we had a pretty bad storm here in AZ. At about 10pm a large part of an HOA-owned tree broke off and landed on top of my car, crushing the aftermarket roof rack entirely and deeply denting/scratching up the exterior of the car pretty bad. The windshield is cracked but not breached. Car seems to drive fine. I moved it to a safer spot the night of the incident.  
I have GEICO car insurance but I don't have comprehensive. Unfortunately, I can't afford it.  
Importantly, this particular tree partially broke and fell on my neighbors home several months ago. So, I would assume that's enough to label this tree a problem.   
The most relevant thing I can find in the HOA documents says:  
""(If) A Tornado destroys a building... Association policy replaces building including 'original' interior elements""

I just got this car so I'm pretty bummed to see it so banged up. I'm also rather broke so I'm not really sure what my options are when it comes to legal counsel.  


I have tons of pictures both from the night it happened and the aftermath.

The landlord had been complaining a while that property taxes had gone up, and he asked us to pay more in rent because he had seen similar places go for more than what we were paying. We said no. He has been raising the rent as much as he is legally allowed for two years until the pandemic put that on hold. We had been renting for 7 years when he said that he could no longer afford to rent the apartment and that him and his wife had decided to sell the apartment. He said we should expect realtors to come in the following week. We said okay and to give us proper notice (24 hrs) to see the suite. We also said we expect the 60 days from possession date. No response. 

Two weeks later and we haven’t heard anything from him. Then one day he says that now he will be moving into the apartment himself. He says him and his wife are having problems and he thought selling the apartment would alleviate that, but that they were now separating. I found this message odd mainly because he gave too much information. We didn’t need to know about his marital issues or the reason. Something about it was just so off. But he drops off the formal notice to end tenancy and so we make other living arrangements. 

A couple days after the 1st of the month he asked us for the last month’s rent (we had always paid right on time), to which we replied that when a tenant is being evicted they do not owe the last months rent (that’s true for where we are located). No response. I’m not sure if he didn’t know that or if he was hoping we didn’t know that. 

Fast forward a few months, and we can see clearly that this man is not living in the apartment. The apartment’s living room windows, kitchen room windows and balcony are all very visible to the main road. It’s one of the things I hated about living there. We see the same woman quite a bit and it’s not his wife. So at first I’m thinking, okay maybe this is his girlfriend? He did say his marriage was in disarray. But that doesn’t make sense because the day after we moved out we saw his wife in there cleaning. I don’t know many women that would clean an apartment for her husband and his girlfriend to move into. Then one day we saw a man, who was not the landlord, in the kitchen. We’ve driven by the landlord’s house a few times and his truck is there every single time. 

So it’s pretty clear at this point that we were evicted illegally, as the landlord is clearly not living there himself like he said. However proving this is another story. Any advice on what our next steps should be? The regulatory body we called were beyond unhelpful and said “can you get them to admit it?” Uh, I’m thinking not. What kind of evidence can we obtain that would prove our landlord has not moved in? Would contacting the building manager or the Strata help?

I'll try to make this short. I plan to delete this, but I need help wrapping my head around it.. I'm hoping I can find some comfort in what you all have to say. Deleting bc it's open..

I learned through a bond company that I had a warrant for a felony terroristic threat. This was a few months ago. I am not in the state the charge is in, but I have a friend who is going to fly up here to drive back to the state (Texas) with me. I learned this while out of state.

What happened: I was working at a chemical plant, (I'll just call them Company) for three years. My father was a superintendent there, and he was laid off ~6 months before I was sent to another of Company's sites. They had been trying to get rid of me for the entire time I was there without him. Didn't like me because I was the superintendent's daughter...

The day they transferred me, I was sort or heartbroken, crying because of how sudden it was and because I would miss my colleagues. Excited to be out of the toxic work environment, but sad to go nonetheless. Gathered my things and all that, then met with the new superintendent and safety man.

We were having a tiny bit of small talk, with Safety Man (who was a good work friend) and Superintendent. Safety Man says ""Alright let's head out the gate.""

Me, knowing the reason they bring people to the gate is to prevent disgruntled employees from causing damages to property, made the STUPID decision to say: 

""Well I don't got a bomb on me or anything!"" (Playfully)

Safety Man: ""Got any explosives on ya, (My name)?""

And I of course dumbly replied with: ""Oh yeah I left them in (Processing unit)""

After this, I hug Superintendent bye, tell him good luck. He also wishes me good luck. (This guy wasn't someone I was close to or anything, but weren't on bad terms)

Then Safety Man and I walk out together, talk for a little and he says ""Well they're just trying to get rid of the (My dad, ex superintendent)'s era""

This exchange happened at 8am

I go to safety council, go to the new plant which is also owned by Company, go through security. When inside (12pm), I learn from New Boss that I am only there to cover for someone who is out with covid for 2 weeks. They mentioned nothing about me being transferred back. I don't think they knew because: 

At ~3pm I call my old foreman while on a break and tell him I'm being transferred back. He responds with ""Are you sure? I'll have to talk to Superintendent""

About 30 minutes later, old colleagues were saying a bomb threat was reported at Company, the old location. I was initially confused and scared until realizing it may have been me they called about. It was.

I know it was more of a political move on their part to keep me from coming back. Even Safety Man has contacted me since, saying he hates 'what they did to me'. 

I knew I wasn't liked by a lot of people there, and not because I'm a mean person or anything. It's dumb to say, but I'm friendly and a hard worker. I think it's just who my dad was, and they didn't like him much.

I've been in contact with lawyers. Only over phone until I make it back. (I'm living in another state, but Dad is going to let me stay with him a while) The court house I'm in is apparently the worst in the district... Despite lawyers being ready to fight it, saying it's blown out of proportion, I am still worried about the outcome. 

I don't know what to expect. I have never been in legal trouble, I'm 24. I feel like every other night I am in tears about this. I can barely sleep.

The point of this is guess is to try to get thoughts and opinions. I know it was dumb to say, but it wasn't said with the intention or frightening anyone. I wouldn't want to hurt these people I'd come to know and care for. It was even taken as a joke at the time, until they learned I was transferring back.

I really want some piece of mind. I should be going back in a little less than a month and actually sitting down with lawyers.

But, towards the end of my first year, I faced some racial discrimination at the hands of the community employees -- about which I complained to their CEO.  
The next year though, I decided to move out of the community two months before my lease ended.  
I asked the leasing office for their advice on whether I should break the lease and pay a 2-month lease-break fee or let the lease expire and pay rent for the remaining two months. I was fine with either option since they both cost me the same. The community told me, over the phone, that I should break the lease. They explained that when I break the lease, I will only have to pay a 2-month rent fee and nothing more; so I did.

&gt;*Note: All conversions with the community employees had to be over the phone as it was their policy during the pandemic.*

My case: A month or so after I moved out, the community sent me the final move out bill, in which they billed me for: carpet replacement, bathtub resurfacing, and fee for not providing timely move-out notice. I disagreed with all those charges, for reasons listed below:

1. Carpet replacement: some $500
2. Bathtub resurfacing: some $300
3. Fee for not providing timely move out notice: some $500

They said they had a third party vendor company inspect the apartment and that vendor noted that the carpet was damaged ""beyond normal wear"" and must be replaced. So, acting on that, they replaced the carpet 8-days after I moved out and are charging me for it.  
**The carpet issue**

*My story:*  When I moved into the apartment the carpet was in like-new condition. To keep it that way, I covered their carpet with an old carpet that I owned. As such, when I moved out, their carpet was still in like-new condition.  
*The argument:* I told the apartment community my story but they didn't buy it. Instead, they sent me a pdf with two move-out inspections, one from a third party vendor and another from the same apartment community (I am hiding their names for obvious reasons). Both inspections had noted that the carpet needs to be changed. The third party vendor's inspection was not signed, had no address (except apartment number) and a date that is barely legible as (6/22). The apartment community changed my carpet on 6/28/2021.  
The move-out inspection done by the apartment community was on 7/22/2021 (after the carpet was replaced on 6/28/2021).The move-out inspection mentions stains on the carpet that cannot be removed but I don't understand how that can be, if the carpet was replaced on 6/28/2021.

Also in the carpet photographs sent by the apartment community leasing office, there were absolutely no stains on the carpet. The leasing office could not point to any stain on the carpet. This photograph was supposedly taken before the carpet was replaced. So, I don't understand how the leasing office can simply declare stains to be present when their own photographs don't show any.  
After a protracted argument over several months, the leasing office waived the carpet replacement charge.  


**The bathtub issue**  
The bathtub surface was damaged and it simply had to be resurfaced.

*My story*:  The bathtub was damaged before I even moved into the apartment. I had even mentioned that the bathtub was damaged on the move-in sheet they provided. As such, I should not be liable for it's resurfacing.  
*The argument*:  I had to point out to them that I had already mentioned about the damage on the move-in sheet and hence, they can't hold me liable for it.  
After I mentioned that my move-in inspection already mentions the bathtub surfacing as damaged, they agreed to remove this charge.

  
**Move-out notice**

*Apartment community's stand*:  I broke the lease and didn't give them sufficient time beforehand and hence, the charge.  


*My story:*  As I mentioned before, I had contacted the apartment community leasing office on 26th May 2021. At that time, the apartment community leasing office mentioned that I would only be charged the 2-month rent as a fee for breaking the lease; nothing more, nothing less. The apartment community gave me the lease-break form to fill only around 2nd June 2021 which I promptly filled and signed in-person.  
*The argument*:  I told them my story, but the apartment community's response was that the lease mentions that this fee will be charged and since the discussion between me and the community employee is not written on paper. They don't consider any discussion between me and the leasing office staff as relevant. Consequently, I wrote a very polite email to the CEO again asking if it was a deliberate practice of this apartment community to not meet face-to-face with tenants, give advice over the phone, and when the tenant complies, tell them that absence of written interaction between tenant and leasing office staff will be used against the tenant.

  
I fought with the apartment community for 2 months over email and finally got all three charges removed. However, I think the apartment community did all this in retaliation for me speaking out about racial discrimination at their place.

Then, they had to send the information over to some 3rd party person and they had to “hand file” the paperwork in 2021. We had to wait about two months for them to hand file it, and now we have been waiting for the hospitals law office to notify his employer that the garnishment has ended. It has been about two/three months and we are still getting garnished. My husband has tried to contact his HR department on countless occasions with no luck. My question is are we able to do anything about this? It has been impeding out ability to pay our monthly bills, and we are struggling to even remain just two months behind on everything. I mostly just want to light a fire under them so they stop the garnishment. However, I’m not sure if trying to find my own lawyer is the right thing to do.

So I am an artist and photographer who sometimes sells work to bands to be used for their releases and/or promotional materials. Recently I sold an image I took to a record label to be used for one of their bands upcoming albums. We negotiated a exclusive licensing agreement, the terms of the agreement outlined use of the image for the bands digital and physical release with a payment owed of $500 for the first 5,000 units. This is my first time drawing up a “legit” licensing agreement. The bands manager is wanting to make some adjustments to the licensing agreement and one of the adjustments is expanding use of the image for PR materials and merchandise. My question is, should I be asking for more money if the image use is being expanded to merchandise? Or is that normally included in a exclusive licensing agreement? This is not a huge band or record label. The manager also told me to make the clarifying adjustments and then send the “license” over. I’m guessing the license is the same thing as the licensing agreement?",legaladvice,Beginner questions regarding a licensing agreement and photography.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p66lmx/beginner_questions_regarding_a_licensing/

She said my boyfriend could have the house, but they never got around to refinancing without her name on mortgage.

Fast forward 5/6 years and my boyfriend and I are dating, I move in, he lost his job last year, so I kept up on all the payments myself until the end of the year. We pay 50/50 now and are having the roof repaired with a loan ($7k) in mine and his names. 

All of that being said, he communicated with her a few weeks ago about his interest in selling the house, he gets a bit of a low offer yesterday ($230k) and wants to keep her in the loop and she's unhappy because it seems a bit low when she's getting 50%.

We will have been renting this property for 3 years as of Dec 2021.

So, since November of 2020, we have had a leak coming through the ceiling in our bathroom and kitchen. The origin of the leak is from the upstairs neighbours. There is allegedly an issue with a pipe leading from their sink/washing machine drainage. The water pours from the ceiling, down behind our cabinets and gets into our sockets which blows the fuse box. We initially discovered the leak after water got into our bathroom extractor fan and blew it out. 

We have been onto our landlord and the property board for the last year, and while we keep being told that the issue has been repaired, within the week the leaking will begin again. This has been ongoing for months, with the most recent leaking incident occurring Saturday gone, where the entire contents of the washing machine upstairs drained into our kitchen through the ceiling. 

The landlord for the upstairs tenants is different to our own landlord. He is apparently MIA and has been extremely difficult to locate to pursue him to fix this issue. 

There is damage to the ceiling in the kitchen and the bathroom. The damage to the ceiling has not been fixed, the plaster is constantly damp and is a breeding ground for mildew and mould. 

My question is; would this leak, while not originating in our apartment and technically not the fault of our landlord, count as a breach of landlord responsibility? Would it count as inhabitable? He has been made aware of it since day 1. While I understand he himself cannot fix the leak, it is becoming a huge source of stress and worry, especially given it is getting into electrical sockets and blowing fuses. My husband and I are not always home, and the worry of coming home to severe flooding, the cabinets fallen off the walls from the damage being done to them from the water, or a fire breaking out from water getting into live sockets is all becoming very overwhelming.

Hello Reddit Legal experts,

I need some advice. This is regarding a very shady behavior of GEICO.

Background: 

I had an accident in December 2019, it was my fault. It was too dark and I hit a parked car on a local street, the other car was totaled. No one was hurt, it’s just how the cars hit - a minivan and a lowered accord - both cars wheel assembly was broken. I live in NC and accident happened in NC too.

I had the car towed to a dealership for repairs but Geico told me if I get the car repaired at their authorized facility, the repairs will be guaranteed for life (until I own the car). The claims adjuster firstly said it was a superficial damage without even looking at the broken wheel assembly and said it will only take $1500 (This was the first estimate).

But before they moved the car to the authorized repair shop, I had already got it evaluated by the dealership and they pointed out the broken wheel assembly which GEICO acknowledged and said they will be back with an estimate. It took them 40 days to get another estimate as they got the car evaluated by 2 different Dealerships. Then the claims adjustor verbally confirmed that they will be totaling my car as it will cost closer to 75% of car value to repair the car. (This was 2nd estimate)

But after a week the claims adjustor supervisor called me and told that he will get the car repaired, as the repair cost will around 50% and there is nothing I can do about it. They mentioned that they will not use original equipment and some of it will be reclaimed (from junkyard) - I fought hard for it and then they said they will not use any reclaimed parts apart from a wheel. Not sure which parts were used. I was really upset regarding this and had reached out to the NC state Insurance inspector but got a generic response that the Insurance can decide whatever and after reading the terms of insurance - they can choose the generic parts. I could not give them a huge fight as this was Feb/March 2020 and the world was closing for the Covid.

I received the car on March 2020 and the final work order was for around $11,000. The cars total worth was calculated to be $19700.

Problem: 

After receiving the car, I have been to the authorized facility once (November 2020) as I could hear cracking sounds from the wheel assembly. They fixed it and said that screws need to be tightened after such a big repair. I have started getting the same cracking sounds again and will be going to them in a couple of days. While researching currently I could not get to the claims paperwork on their website (which is weird in its own way) but I had called them to get the documents. With the latest documents which were shared with me the cost of the total repair was $13400. Approx 68% of the car value.

GEICO apparently spent more than 75% of the car value to fix the car as they gave me a rental for 2.5 months.

Advice Needed: Since I am getting a problem again with the car and the amount GEICO spent to repair the car, Can I push them now to total car. I am really scared to drive it and really can’t sell the car knowingly to have these issues as it will be unethical as well as it will not fetch any money with these issues. I have taken it to the dealership for diagnosing the problem and their response was that the work is really massive on wheel assembly and they do not want to touch it and be held liable.

My mother died in June and I just received the autopsy.  It states that she passed from sudden cardiac arrest caused by her medication.  She was taking Geodon, an antipsychotic, for extreme bipolar disorder.  Along with that fact, she had been mentally declining for some time.  She would have been 65 last month.  She was showing signs of possible dementia for quite a few months.  She lived alone in NJ and I live in NY so it was hard to fully gauge what was going on.  She forgot her birth year and she also managed to spend an entire day lost while driving.  She was very forgetful.   Her husband died last September so I think the family wrote it off as her being unable to handle her husband's death.

Everything I've read about Geodon is that it is contraindicated in elderly patients with dementia.  It does say that it's not recommended for people over 65, which she wasn't.  But whose job is it to know if she had dementia?  Should her doctors and psychiatrist have been able to tell?   Would the autopsy show signs of early dementia?  Everyone who knew her noticed a change but none of us knew enough to see it as dementia.  Should I consult an attorney, or should I just accept that she must have been informed of the risks of taking the medication?  Should ""sudden death"" just be an accepted side effect of a medication just because it's listed as a possibility?  Was it fatal to her because she had undiagnosed dementia?

My ex and I were together for a few year and lived together for a good chunk of our relationship. 6 months before we broke up I adopted a dog that we both cared for. We used a shared credit card to pay for her. However, I am her sole adopted on her adoption certificate and all of her medical records/microchip.

I took my dog and left my ex without warning because of continuous emotion, physical, and sexual abuse he was putting me through along with infidelity. I have plenty of proof (photos and texts) and prove that he caused this abuse. I feared for my safety and life so I blocked him on everything and have completely cut contact.

He’s tried reaching out to me multiple times since but the last I heard from him was in March. I exchanged 1 text conversation with him in February basically telling him to leave me alone. Other than that he hasn’t spoken to or seen me and the dog in a year.

I genuinely believe this is once again an attempt at him trying to get into contact with me to either try to take control over me using me dog or honestly just see me. Why wait an entire year to go after “your” dog? (This was filed July 2021)

Anyways, we have a zoom hearing scheduled and I want to know how and who I go about bringing this information to so we do not see each other during this meeting. I’m already having panic attacks daily and insomnia just thinking about him. I would not be able to function if I have to see my abusers face.

I started as a housekeeper but started experiencing severe back pain. I was taking several Aleve a day just to get through the day, but was still experiencing pain. I got prescription Naproxen from my doctor and it only helped for a few days then Aleve stopped working too. I asked my supervisor (Assistant GM) and the GM if I could move to the recently vacant laundry attendant position. They agreed and I was in that position for about a month. My back pain alleviated in this time. Last week we were told that three of the housekeepers were quitting. The newly hired Housekeeping Supervisor said that since they were quitting that I needed to start cleaning rooms again. She said that I need to get a note from my doctor saying that I can't work that position, but in the meantime I need to clean rooms. The back pain started again almost immediately. I've been waking up in the middle of the night almost every night in pain. She said that she has back problems too and can do this work with no issues so I should be fine.

On Sunday I clocked in just before 8:00am and started cleaning around the property. Around 9:00am the Housekeeping Supervisor comes to me and says that some of the rooms I was assigned had checked out so I went to start cleaning them. I had 5 priority rooms (rooms that guests are checking into that day). How I like to do rooms is to get them all done at once (strip all the dirty linens in each room, make all the beds in each room, clean with cleaning products, etc.) So by 10:00am or so I had all the rooms stripped of dirty linens, towels and trash. By around 11:00am I had all the beds made in all five rooms. Around that time my housekeeping supervisor said that I needed to start getting rooms completely done so she could check them off the list. So I focused on 3 rooms that were near each other for the next couple of hours. I cleaned them and placed the soaps and fresh towels, etc. Around 12:30 all that had to be done in those 3 rooms was the beds needed to be steamed and the floors needed to be vacuumed. I tried to start steaming the beds and the steamer was malfunctioning (not uncommon). I told the housekeeping supervisor the situation and asked if I could take my lunch break and finish up the rooms real quick when I got back. She got very angry and went on saying that all my coworkers had finished at least 3 rooms except for me. I tried explaining that I was having trouble finding a machine that worked and that the vacuums were all being used. She just snapped at me and said that I can't leave until I get all of my rooms done. She then started asking why I hadn't gotten one of the non-priority rooms done. She said that it was the only one that was checked out at 9:00am when she handed me the keys. I tried explaining that, that wasn't true because my rooms were marked on the list as checked out and I started working on them immediately. This made her even angrier. I tried to tough it out and finish the priority rooms so my coworkers wouldn't have to do them but I ultimately left around 1:00pm. I was starving, in pain, and depressed.

What kind of legal counsel should we look into if any? The mother very much wants to get rid of the baby, but is against abortion and we would gladly take the child off of her hands.

The office is still trying to bill me, a year later, and I am no longer living in the US nor do I have insurance there, but the bills are being sent to my family's house in Florida. I contacted six Florida state agencies regarding healthcare, consumer protection, and the attorney general, and got nowhere. The entire story is on my post over in the r/healthinsurance sub, but I was recommended to come here to see what the next steps are:

One user who directed me here had a summarized suggestion to go about it like this: Send them a letter stating that this is disputed, and that I will not be paying it. They are to stop contacting me immediately, and ensure my overseas address is on the letter.

The user claimed *""This forces them to either stop contacting you, or to sue. Your being overseas makes suing even more expensive for them. Just watch out, you'll likely get a 1099 for forgiven debt (possibly even on the original amount) and that could be taxable income. There are strategies for that too (letter to the IRS of insolvency, maybe others)""*

*Secondary Question:  How expensive/time consuming/fair are arbitration panels generally/in NYC specifically?*

Hello all, my wife and I recently engaged a lawyer in New York City to advise on our purchase of an apartment after the seller accepted our verbal offer.  We signed a retainer/paid $2,500 as a retainer amount, with a 'fee cap' of $5,000 (reduced rates above the fee cap).

After retaining the lawyer, they proceeded to be unresponsive, requiring frequent outreach from us to get updates/push to respond, etc.  At various points our lawyer said that they had not received documents from seller's attorney that had in fact been sent.  Our lawyer was also combative on deal points that were important to the seller that we were not fully informed of.

After more than a week, we were still not in contract, and we were informed that the seller had taken another offer.   The other offer was all-cash/higher in $ terms, which obviously is not our lawyer's fault. However, the other offer only materialized because after over a week and were frankly not 24 hours from signing.

This was obviously disappointing for us, and we were surprised to get a bill for in excess of the retainer (&gt;$3,000).  The invoice included a reconciliation of hours; punchline is that &lt;3 of the \~7 hours were spent on the doc (which still feels high given we never got beyond Ctrl+F'ing to put names in/striking the 'to be removed' sections of standard docs).  The reconciliation also includes a few calls etc where the time seems inflated vs. what our phone records show, but I realize there are some other things that can be categorized there so am not accusing our lawyer of inflating the bill per se.

I responded to the lawyer letting him know we were surprised and unhappy with the bill, but am curious how viable it is to seek a discount/return of any portion of our retainer.  For reference, we have the option for arbitration under 22 NYCRR Part 137; I am also curious if anyone has a view on how that process might go for us given we do not have accusations of specific wrong-doing.",legaladvice,Contesting Lawyer's bill on botched real estate deal?,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p64gb6/contesting_lawyers_bill_on_botched_real_estate/

So this is a long story but I'd like some advice on whether we are responsible/liable for repairs (security deposit taken away when we move?) 

We almost bought the house we are currently renting from our landlord earlier this year. We were under contract and got a home inspection and found numerous spots of mold/water damage which were copied &amp; pasted from the report and sent to landlord. Some of these issues were ""repaired"" in the past while we lived here but still showed signs of not being repaired correctly. The landlord got a mold inspector who said they found no issues of water damage &amp; a repairman for the roof who they claimed fixed any potential leaks. We still didn't feel comfortable moving forward and exited contract under due diligence period (there were other issues that were not addressed). They aren't forcing us to move and since the inspection there has been visible water leaks, we have to leave pots and pans out to catch the water. We reported this to our landlord and its been a few months since the inspection. I'm curious if we could get blamed for these issues or if the inspection report and our prior communications of the issue shows that the landlord had knowledge and didn't take necessary repairs. 

We are looking for a place to move, it's a tough market right now for renters.

So long story short I sold a set of golf clubs for $700. I went to ship them using an eBay label via USPS they said they couldn't accept the box using that service as it was too big and they couldn't do any other of the labels eBay provides. I went to UPS and they said the same thing so I ended up paying $175 out of pocket because eBay couldn't give me a correct label. Called them and they refused to refund me because they said it was an ""outside label"" even though they're the ones that caused it in the first place (in my opinion).  I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau over it and am waiting to hear back.

Skip ahead to the payout and they take out almost $200 in fees and I only get a payout of around $500. So now I'm out over $300 between fees and shipping costs.  I've added this to my complaint along with screenshots and I plan to call eBay again after work to maybe get at least some of the fees refunded and I filed a report with the FTC.

Any advice on any other actions I can take besides what I've already done would be much appreciated.

Since 2018 I moved into a living situation where we lived in a house advertised as an apartment. It is a 5 (advertised as 6) bed room house with a living room, 2 bedrooms a bathroom and a kitchen downstairs (a small back room too that isn’t big enough to be a bedroom though advertised as one) and 3 bedrooms upstairs, living room, kitchen, bathroom.

The situation only worked as a double house unit because my sister and her kids lived in the downstairs. I want to be clear this would have never worked with randoms strangers. There is no real separation or privacy. You can hear all throughout the house. It wasn’t ideal. 

Fast forward to mid 2020 my sister moves out because of some drama in result leaving the downstairs vacant. We upstairs however continued to pay our rent on time and not using the downstairs except for when my dad went into hospice care (early this year) and we had permission to have his bed and things downstairs (this lasted about 2-3 weeks.) After he passed we went back to only using the upstairs and paying the rent we were supposed to pay.

Well, the landlord drops a bombshell on us mid June saying he’s selling the house and we would be dealing with a new landlord. No other real details. June goes by, July comes in. We hear nothing until he tells us someone is coming by to take pictures. Ends up being some kid who looks like he’s maybe 17/18 and he tells us the new landlord is out of town and he’s taking pictures for him. Said he’d be back the next day but never came back. We have had 0 contact with this new landlord.

The rest of July goes by we hear absolutely nothing. August comes in we pay the old landlord the rent. He tells us it’s the last time we will probably pay him as the deal is going to be finalized next week. Again no details on the new landlord, how to contact him/her, etc. fast forward to last Friday my lights get cut off. They are apart of the rent as well as water. We call the companies he had them cut off and it was listed as vacant. We called him trying to figure out what was going on he ignored our calls majority of the day until finally calling back. He told us that he didn’t actually know who the new landlord was he never talked to them in person, it was all done through a conglomerate and the new landlord said that they had talked to us (they haven’t) he’s said he had the green light to cut utilities off but said nothing to us to even warn us. We were able to get them back on in our name luckily though they originally told us we would have to wait until this week before cutting them back on. The problem now is… We still have no clue who the new person is, the old landlord claims not to know anything at all, and gave us a phone number to call that doesn’t even work. 

I guess my question is what are our legal grounds right now? Our lease was verbal and month to month (we paid August already) so I would assume the lights being cut out on us would have been illegal? There’s also the fact we don’t know if someone can just show up and kick us out.

He yelled about it a couple of times, but I've otherwise never interacted with them. The reason I know his medical status is because I did call the police and that's what they were told.

About three months ago, they installed another security camera. They already had one pointing at the road behind their house, but this one is pointing directly at my (upper) deck and kitchen windows.

I've spoken with the PD since the initial string of incidents, and they said that since it's not pointing at my bedroom, there's nothing they can do other than ask nicely, which they did. For a brief stint the guy was mad at someone else so he recorded their house for a while, but it's now back to pointing at me.

I know it's recording audio because he called the police on me for talking. The police told him that they can't tell me not to talk, and made me aware. I don't know how well the audio is recorded, I assume not very well but who knows.

I'm generally getting tired of this, and I'm already putting up constant visual barriers to avoid the camera, and it's just uncomfortable being outside for any reason. Is there anything I can do other than keep putting up more fences, screens, tall plants, and whatever else I can to at least not be filmed constantly? 

I have not communicated with this man since he swore at me a few months ago. The camera is on his property, up on a hill, so it's recording from an area not otherwise available to the public unless they trespassed - it is at least 20ft from the road itself which I assume is the public property equivalent. There is nothing else recorded other than my deck and the upper floor, as the camera angle de facto excludes the public access road. Think of it like a valley where we're on one side of the hill, and they're on the other - with the public access road between them.

Hi everyone! I need an advice for real estate.

3 years ago I purchased a home and after closing date our real estate agent offered a check to have her represent us in the future when we decide to sell the house. We agreed because we wanted to work with her again.

Fast forward to now, we decide to sell our house and contacted the real estate agent and found that the real estate company let go the real estate agent and took over all of her contracts and now we have a binding contract with the real estate company and not our agent. She's is currently in a legal battle with the agency because they took all of her clients and legally she's not allowed to represent them.

When we signed the agreement her name was present on the papers and now they sent us a copy of the agreement and it's between the agency and us. In the agreement it states that we're obligated to work with them for next 50 years, and if we want to terminate the agreement we have to pay 13000$.

Here is a link to the news of a similar case someone else is going thru with the same agency: [https://www.wftv.com/news/action9/action-9-investigates-realtor-offer-homeowners/HK5MX3SMXZF2LKHUPMIQWR7CVE/](https://www.wftv.com/news/action9/action-9-investigates-realtor-offer-homeowners/HK5MX3SMXZF2LKHUPMIQWR7CVE/)

My close friend, lets call him Sam, is helping an elderly former friend of his mothers. The elderly friend, lets call her Lucy, is about 100 years old and is pretty abusive to my friend. She doesn't care about him and will even order him to go buy her stuff even if it's a bad time for him e.e.g when his mother was recently in the hospital and not doing well (she's better now and isn't in the hospital anymore). He buys Lucy groceries about 2 times a week so she can avoid ending up in a nursing home. I'm pretty sure she pays him back each time. He's been doing this for several years now and feels compelled to keep doing it. Reason being she has told him that he will inherit money from her when she's dead and he really needs the money as he's in a bad situation. I won't go into details but if things go wrong, he could potentially end up on the streets if he's relying too much on that money. Apparently a family friend of Sam's told him he stands to inherit this woman, Lucy. I don't think this is true as Sam isn't in any way related to Lucy. Lucy by the way has no living relatives and no friends because she has been so abusive to everyone.So from what I can remember, since he isn't a blood relative, he has no foot to stand on legally if she's lying to him. I don't think he knows for a fact if he's been mentioned in her will. He's just hoping he is. My fear is he's putting up with abuse from this woman who's using money to keep him doing things for her and he'll potentially end up with nothing or not enough to buy a house/apartment. I would hate for that to happen because he's a really good friend of mine and I don't want to see things go badly for him if this woman is lying to him to use him and his family friend is either mistaken or is lying to him too for some reason.

I'm also not sure if he dares to ask to see the will out of fear she'll decide not to let him inherit anyway, if she's telling the truth that is.

 Because not knowing law is not considered as an excuse.

When I do something or plan something I have an urge to read the law or experiences of others to seek reassurance that I am not doing anything illegal.

The rules of that probation say he is NOT to contact me or come to my residence or place of work.

I decided the other day to power up my old cellphone and checked my old fake Facebook profile I made in another name to talk to friends after I moved. My ex messaged me there, first asking who I was (despite me never contacting him) and then going on about how he hopes to see me again and how he's never giving up. The message is dated December 2020 either a few weeks or a month after our last court/zoom hearing where he was told he was supposed to not contact me.

We live in a *very small very rural* town in PA. There are currently 2 judges that reside in the county. Currently only one of those judges resides over family court. So here's the situation we're facing: My SIL has 2 kids, the baby daddy (we'll call Jim) is only the actual father of 1 of the children. He has the kids every other week and is basically acting as daddy to both kids. Problem is, Jim is a drug buyer/seller and emotional abuser and has started abusing the child that is not technically his. She is 8  with an emotional capacity of about 5ish but has come home for the past few months in hysterics that she absolutely does not want to go to daddy's again. She says that he is calling her a liar and a bitch and asking if she wants him to kill himself because of her and she is afraid. We have her on tape, hysterical, stating all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's the even bigger problem. When the SIL and Jim were together and both getting high every day and whatnot, SIL witnessed Jim sell drugs to the same judge that resides over court. Since then, when they have gone to court, Jim has been granted crazy things like partial custody of a child that is not legally his, which is why we're in this mess.  There's no other judges and our lawyer has advised us that if we even try to take anything like the recording to the judge he could very well take away what little we do have in the situation with the kids.

During the last year I produced some content for an online entertainment company which pays via ad revenue. In May I was supposed to receive my first payout, which i selected to get via check. May comes and goes, no check. I email customer support in June, and ever since it has been one massive back and fourth that feels a lot like going in circles. Tl;dr at first they said the check was sent but never cashed so they would reissue my payment, now they came back and said that actually it was cashed so I'm SOL. 

I've been trying so hard to make them understand that this check never made it to me and that i did not cash it, but now they insist that it is ""impossible "" for someone else to cash a check that's not made out in their name!!! This mf solved bank fraud somehow. 

Is there anything i can do?? It's really not a lot of money, and I am fortunate to be able to say it's not about the money at all at this point, i just want some accountability.

Our current lease expires 30th August. We signed a tenancy agreement on a new property with a new letting agent (LA) last week, paid all the deposits etc. and was due to move in on Monday 16th August. The LA called us on Saturday (14th Aug) to tell us the current tenant had not moved out and they could not get in touch with him. We emailed and called all day Monday with absolutely no response from the LA.  LA called this morning (Tuesday 16th Aug)  to tell us tenant refuses to move out until October.

It turns out the current tenant had wanted to pay LA outright to leave his contract early as he had to move to Scotland at the start of August. LA refused, but said they would give him an early release if they found new tenants before then. LA claim they had been in touch with him the whole time to tell him they had new tenants etc. He has now refused to move out and wants to stay until October as per his original tenancy agreement.

As we cannot wait until October for the property and as the LA has breached the contract, we requested all of our deposit back this morning as we are unhappy with how they have treated us and would not longer want to rent through them.

We would like to raise a formal complaint, however it states you need to ""detail what resolution you seek"", and now we feel we cannot/should not do this as we have already received our deposit back and aren't sure what else we can reasonably ask for as a resolution.

I have already reached out to my lawyer, I am just awaiting his response and thought to ask you wonder folks what you think.


Around 2 months ago we sold our business. The buyers of our business have only paid us the purchase price but have not reimbursed us for the lease deposit plus the first months rent that was transferred over to them. Even though it clearly states that we are to be reimbursed in our contract. We have since then had our attorney send out a demand letter and they responded today (directly to us) that they will team up with our landlord and both parties will counter sue because “ dues they had to pay and all the work was done by illegal contractors”. ( We have yet to hear anything from the LL not sure why they are involving the LL into this but to me it just seems like a scare tactic)

So my questions are:

1). Can they counter sue if the contract specifically states that “this is an as is sale. Seller provides no guarantees for the quality or the state of the purchase assets…or the condition of the premise.”

2). I have an indemnification clause in the contract where the buyers will indemnify me. Will this be one of those instances? Especially if they get the landlord involved?",legaladvice,Suing for breach of contract and the other party is threatening to counter sue.,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p61xf0/suing_for_breach_of_contract_and_the_other_party/

That area was previously a dense, natural brush line with medium-sized trees (as tall as my one story house, but the kind with trunks that make them shrub-like, I'm not sure of the species). They were not planted in a straight line, and we aren't sure exactly where the property line is. But all signs (old fence posts, the county's GIS map, etc.) suggest that the majority of the trees are either on my side of the line or directly on the line (making them shared property). 

He called me at work that day, when the tree trimming crew arrived, and left a voicemail asking if they could come onto my property. I responded with a text clearly stating that they may not come onto my property. Then came home several hours later to find the entire brush line gone, and obvious signs that they had been on my property. There was also a (much less serious) previous instance where he trimmed things on my side of the fence himself. And, even after I had expressed my displeasure about this brush line being removed, it appears that his crew may have come back a 2nd day and cut more things on my side of the property line. 

The neighbor remains unapologetic and keeps insisting that I'll be happy with the end result- a more manicured look that he desires and I do not. He continues to blow right past the fact that I am telling him he can't touch anything on my side of the line.

My question now: is it worth it to sue him? What can I expect the costs (surveyor, lawyer, arborist, etc.) to be? What kind of damages could I expect to get? (I'm in IL if that matters) Is there any way the court wouldn't rule in my favor here? Would I need to go after the tree trimming company as well?

I have everything squared away except for his vehicle.

I made a post a few weeks ago, very thankful for the help. I'm in such a pickle with nobody to trust really. Basically my grandparents got dementia and went down hill. I had been in contact with my uncle and brother. Our mother is dead and my grandparents only had her and my uncle. Well, they did not notify me at all, They had my grandparents house sold. Then they had them moved across the country to where my uncle lives. I did not know any of this until I found out my grandfather was about to pass of covid in the start of 2021.  


I talked to him before he passed. I was told my grandmother had stabilized, was planning a trip. Well, I was contacted by my uncle and brother for my address. Turns out my grandmother had passed not long after and nobody notified me at all. I was notified because apparently there was no will, which is crazy for them I thought. Now my uncles lawyer is sending me information about letting him be administrator.  


Now I have been told by my brother he doesn't trust my uncle and said that money may have been mismanaged or some hidden. My brother plans to contest my uncle and wants the state to be administrator and wants a forensic investigation on my uncle. I've been told a lawyer costs a lot of money, not sure where I would contact one or if I should. I just want my grandparents wishes and property respected.  


My uncle literally hasn't told me any information about the estate or any wills. I try to get information and it seems like they are avoiding it. I really don't know what to do at this point. I received papers again from my uncles lawyer urging to make him administrator. But, he didn't even contact me about it being sent. I'm not sure how to access any information about their estate. The hearing for administrator is next month.   


They had their house sold for way less than market value and they were not fit to make choices at the time. We are worried my uncle had been moving money around. Anyways if anyone has experience with this sort of thing and could suggest what my next move should be logically it would be an awesome help.

I originally had it all set up to leave prior to me even finding out I was pregnant and then covid numbers messed up me going home to Australia. I have family that were in a different part of America so I chose to leave the state I was in to stay with them until I could get home. They had me on bed rest as the twins developed TTTS. I was scheduled for a surgery in California on a Monday but an unfortunate turn of events happened where the police raided my families house the Saturday night prior. They forced me to stand the entire time (6 hours) and because I put such strain / stress on my body, my water ended up breaking and I lost the babies at 6 months along - the following Monday (the same day I was supposed to have surgery) 

I’m somewhat resentful of my situation. Of the babies father. Of the police. Of the doctor. Of everything. I wish this was a magical update where I could say I got away with them and they would be crying in their cribs within a months time but life didn’t turn out that way. I do however find some peace in knowing they only ever knew my heartbeat, my voice and my love. Anyway, thank you. All of you. You helped me realise what a dangerous situation I was in and gave me tips to get out. I wish nothing but the best for all of you. 


[eta] I did notify the father and he said he was flying out and coming to the hospital. I advised him he wouldn’t be allowed in to which he said “this isn’t fair to me. I want to be there.” Fuck fairness, I lost both of my babies. He wanted me to FaceTime him to show him my babies. He said “I want closure, my kids just died.” You didn’t even believe they existed until this moment. They’re not your kids. They’re mine. I still did though. Lastly, he said “I’m sorry *we* went through this” as if he ever cared about them and not just about using them to control me.",legaladvice,[UPDATE] illegal to go home to a different country while pregnant,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p609pa/update_illegal_to_go_home_to_a_different_country/

I had permission to be there on the boat that day (nothing signed) and have all sorts of videos from the same day on my computer with him on camera where you can see there was no issue with filming at the time. The public video I posted only has me on the top floor balcony of his house boat talking to the camera and joking around with his girlfriend at the time. The issue is they broke up, she has a temporary restraining order on him, and he hates my guts for helping her escape.

Tonight he saw me out in public and cornered me to tell me if I don't remove the video where I ""filmed without his permission on private property"" he's gonna ""sue the fuck out of me"" and apparently he already consulted a lawyer and I've been warned.

The whole video is quite positive because my YouTube channel is just about me going around with my dogs to pick up litter. The one moment you can see him I blurred him out but we were just out on the lake for that clip.

My question is, does he have a case? It seems I could easily be seen as being in the wrong. I posted the video like 2 months after filming it.  He brought it up to the judge in court for the restraining order and that was the only thing the judge ignored.

The video was never monetized so I made 0 dollars from it.

The school’s dress code states that boys hair must be above the collar and over the ear. They expect everyone to get a buzz cut. My son’s hair is about two feet long. He doesn’t want to cut his hair and we (mom &amp; dad) support his decision. 

We sent them a letter stating that this policy violated his rights. They told us he would be on in school suspension if he didn’t cut his hair by Monday.

The case basically states that it is a violation of a student’s rights to enforce a dress code based on gender stereotypes.

Monday, our son was placed on in school suspension in spite of the Cease &amp; Desist letter. We are still looking for legal counsel but have to file our Level 1 Grievance with the school tomorrow. They keep reiterating that they will not stop in school suspension. That he MUST cut his hair immediately. They even threatened to take him to cosmetology, which they teach on campus.

Official hours are the business hours but due to fluctuations in customers, most days are 7.5-8 while slow days can end early at 5-6 hours.   
**In-store staff:** Less than 5 people. 

We have never been given 10 minute breaks and we pool tips. I never minded either of these policies as honestly the job is quite lax - us being late was understood so long as we all communicated and filled in the gaps as a team, unpaid lunches could be longer than 30 mins if it was slow, etc. So it's not a big deal to split tips. Until we got a manager.

He is interfering with my work, not cooperating/making processes less efficient, leaving me to do most of the service/manual labor, and I still split my tips with him. Additionally, the system we uses bases commission on member signups based on the login info of the person checking customers out. I'm usually in the back doing more manual labor (no one else wants to do it) and have to trust that manager/coworker/boss is giving me any commission for customers I served that sign up. I don't think they usually do. Every paycheck I have 0-1 sign ups despite serving 30-100% of tables.

I don't see how it's fair that I have to split tips for tables we're not sharing work on, and whoever is in front gets to take all the commission for club sign ups that result from happy customers. Sometimes work conversations turn hostile - not discriminatory I don't think, but I'm not sure since I do *technically* have a disability and I know nothing about California/US law on that. I honestly don't even care about proving that anyways. I just in general feel like my weaknesses socially speaking + strong work ethic has led to me being taken advantage of. 

**Questions I want to know:**   
**- Are we supposed to have paid 10 minute breaks?** 

**- Can someone with the title of manager split tips if they service tables?** 

I'm not wanting to be sue-happy here, I just want to know my legal rights as people are becoming more hostile/combative during work hours. I'm working 4-6 hours straight only to split my tips with someone who is sitting on their phone while I'm sweating bullets, and those ""lax"" policies are no longer benefiting the other employees as much as they're benefiting the manager/boss.

I worked there for four months last year until the pandemic caused the museum to close and I was initially laid off and then put on furlough. During the closure, the museum unionized. In May of this year, we reopened. I’ve worked there since and did a fantastic job, according to my coworkers and many members of upper management. Some others, however, seemed to take a disliking to me.

On Friday, I was suddenly called into the HR Director’s office. She told me that I was being fired for using my phone on the museum floor, which isn’t explicitly prohibited in the employee handbook and every one of my coworkers did the same thing. I was even sending something to the work chat when a step-in manager caught me and said it was not allowed; several of my coworkers replied to that message within minutes. And apparently I took a 20m break vs. the 10 minutes we’re allowed a few weeks ago. 

Since the meeting was impromptu, I wasn’t given the opportunity to have Union reps present for it. They weren’t even aware that this was in the works. 

The whole firing took me off guard. I couldn’t get a word out but hoarsely asked the HR woman and my female supervisor if I could go to the bathroom. They said it was fine. After crying on the floor of the single-stall restroom for less than five minutes, the HR lady unlocked the door, told me to act like an adult, and said I needed to leave the premises. 

That event was highly traumatizing. I keep having flashbacks to it. 

And also, the HR woman said the 90-day probationary period has only been in effect since we reopened and so they could let me go for any reason. I should have seniority status since I’ve worked there closer to 7 months in total and definitely have &gt;90 days under my belt.

I’ve always just had to sit in my room staying as invisible as possible because that’s the best shot I had at protecting myself.

In January 2020 I ordered a couch (\~$500) that was never delivered to my house \[USA, Texas\]. Over the next several months I asked the store for a refund via a known valid email. They never answered. In July 2020 I got a notification that they were delivering a couch to my apartment. I already had a couch at this point so I canceled it. (To be fair I did cancel late. I tried calling in the morning but nobody answered so I had to turn the truck drivers away before calling the store back again. In any case I never signed for the couch) I asked over the phone for a refund - they told me all sales were final but I could elect to get equivalent compensation at the store. 

Well I've dragged my feet on taking any legal action. I'm out $500 without anything to show for it. Did I wait far to long to do anything about it?  From this [texas.gov](https://texas.gov) page it seems to say that I have up to 2 years to file a claim. Does that apply in this case?

In League of Legends you can be punished for responding to people who are harassing you which is just insane to me. And when they show you your logs and explain why your account (which you put real money in) gets restricted from features etc, they don't show both sides. They just show what you said, and you look like a mad person just going crazy and and disturbing the peace, they don't show that what you're saying is a response to what someone else told you.

My cousin is now nearing 40 and his younger cousin has decided to share the abuse now, resulting in a warrant for his arrest.

The issue is she is also accusing him of many things he did *not* do, including penetrative non-consensual sex and threats to her well-being if she didn't keep quiet. Also, from what I gather, my male cousin was not mentally well at the time of the abuse - he was very depressed and had his parents not been so neglectful, they may have noticed he was unwell. Not that this makes it okay, but I don't know if that could count as a plea of insanity or if it would just sound like an excuse. I'm not too well-versed in legal matters, hence me being here.

From what I understand, sexual abuse of minors has no statute of limitations in PA, so the fact that 20 years have passed likely makes no difference, but I don't know what happens when *both* parties were under the age of consent at the time the abuse occurred. I know for a fact my cousin has not committed more acts of abuse since then, but I don't know if that is helpful at all because it doesn't undo the ones he did commit.

I don't defend my cousin's actions in the least, but at the same time, I don't want to see him go to jail for 40 years because the victim is making things up to make the abuse sound worse either. 

Can I ask what he can expect as far as what happens next? Is jail time a guaranteed outcome of this kind of accusation? The thing is there is absolutely no proof any of this happened, so while there is no way to prove my cousin's innocence or guilt, there is also no way to prove the victim is telling the truth.

This situation feels ridiculous and I want advice on what specific laws are on my side for this.

I work at a dog grooming salon. I started as a bather and have gotten to learn other jobs like reception and even some grooming tips and skills from just talking to grooming coworkers. I have told my boss since coming I want to help how I can and being a groomer sounds fun and would love to learn from this business to become one.

I understood from the get go how a number of things would go down. I have to pay for my own tools, I get a set percentage commission from each dog I groom, etc. A lot of what I was told and prepared for by other employees made a lot of sense. Until my coworker and I were alone one late day and explained why she turned in her notice that she's leaving once she moves in a few months.

She told me that our boss tried some sketchy shit when she first trained her to be a groomer and even now she wants to honestly consider lawyering up against our boss due to potential retaliation she suffered. The way it all sounded seemed so absurd at first. She told me this both to share and warn me and I took her words with a grain of salt, as my boss has been distant but never broke any laws from what I know about her. A part of me hoped if this was all true that my boss had learned from this and would be more ethical at this point. I was wrong.

I was told Friday (writing this Monday night) that she would call me Sunday on my day off and go over the general assessment of my transition to training and that I had to sign a contract before starting training.

Jump to Sunday late afternoon and she finally calls me. It all goes as I expected, but then when we discuss payment, she tells me I won't get any. When asking her to explain, she states she's giving me a $5,000 skill that I would have to pay a school that kind of money to learn it so she believes it's fair to not pay me while I train until I become my own groomer. I'm still expected to pay for my kit with this in mind, and she also mentioned how after I become my own groomer there's a preliminary period where a portion of my commission goes back into the shop to repay her for teaching me this skill on top of not paying me.

I told her that made me uncomfortable and that I needed time to consider my options and consider negotiation options that would be fair to her. She spent the rest of the phone call trying to convince me this was an amazing opportunity and deal for me. 

She mentioned earlier too that she had a lawyer look over the contract, but I doubt it as California has some strict unpaid internship rules. She asked what time I would have a solid answer and I told her Tuesday, as that was the expected day I would sign the contract.

I went over labor laws trying to find anything specific to call her out for, but not even 20 minutes later she calls me back saying she really needs an answer now so she can know if she needs to look for another groomer. I felt this was rude, but I told her no unless she was willing to negotiate. Her only offer to negotiate is that she would waive the preliminary period for my commissions, but that I would still train without payment. I said until she was willing to change the contract further, it would be a no from me.

Due to this all being over the phone, I never got to see the contract to see what the hard deadlines were for everything. She would throw out numbers like 3-4 months of training and a month of preliminary commission work, but without the contract I can't see for sure if she actually states deadlines which means she could try and keep me working for free for months longer. It also discourages me that she said she was still discussing estimated training periods with my potential teacher yet already had the contract ready.

Another aspect I don't agree with is she compares this training to a school, but a quick google search shows all the schools that ask for high payment fees offer a grooming kit as part of the class cost and they give certificates, and licenses after finishing the classes. I know there is no way she could do the same so this training is solely so she can have me work with her, but I wouldn't have any paperwork if I were to leave this job that might credit my grooming to any other company.

The phone call left with her stating I could stay a bather and I agreed that would be best. She texted me saying she wants to go over all this with me in person. I worry it'll just be her trying to pressure me more in person and I would like some info on whether what she's doing is truly legal and just dumb, or actually illegal. I don't have the contract yet, but if I get a copy soon I'll update everyone with the official contract jargon.

What should i do?

Below here is vioce to text please excuse google voice to text.... Am I very tired after dictating this all out over 2 hours and need to sleep for my .... Dentists apointment .... Early Tommorow.... 

There is more to this story. I have collected dates and receipts from over that time. I even have to contact these people over twitter to figure out why repair was taking so long. I will put the events bellow.

On March 3rd I took off the bottom of the computer in order to inspect the damage because I had put my laptop down on my bed with it closed and I raised the lid and the screen turned on and then very suddenly when I shined a light back up the scream through the Apple logo it lit up mean the LCD was working but the fact like was dead so I started taking initial photos of how everything looked when I opened it up.

The next day , Thursday March 4th, I contacted Micro Center authorized repair via text because pandemic in order to figure out what was wrong and sent them some very close up photos of the internals that they were concerned about none of which appeared to have any physical damage or water temp.

I thought over the next day oh, Friday March 5th, and I decided that I wanted to replace the left speaker and the screen on my own as they were likely very serviceable according to the person I met with micro center people.
I was given a quote for 575 and 99 cents plus $99 for labor and given the part number.
   I thought my computer would only be out for a few days while I waited for the pristine condition screen to come in. So I simply took photos for every step and as gently as I could figured it out how to get the right hand speaker out which when flipped upside down is the left speaker.
    For reference I have a degree in electrical systems engineering technology. Which is halfway degree between a technician and an engineering job.
There was no continuity when I tested the output of the left speaker so I tore it apart for the magnet because it wasn't working anyway.
That day I put in an order which I have an email for to iFixit for a display assembly B stock for 479.99.
     This was supposed to mean that it might have scratches and other cosmetic damage on it but it will otherwise function and it might also have dead pixels.
    They did a quick assessment to see if anything else was broken. nothing else was broken at the time, just the back light for the screen everything else, they diagnosed as working.

In between then and oh, Tuesday March 9th, I did not have my computer as it was being assessed by them the people at Microcenter. And I was waiting on my extra display but I bought to come in from iFixit.

On Tuesday March 9th, I took my computer from Microcenter after all of the issues were confirmed to only be with the display backlight and took it the computer to the nearest third-party repair center.
    When I got there they said that they personally couldn't deal with it but they knew someone in any nearby place could do it who was in the same third party repair franchise. Just north of me in Northern Cincinnati.
    When I got there they said that they were all busy the time but they would have free slots to repair my computer in like 2 weeks. I explained to the person in charge of that franchise location that I just didn't want to give you money to Apple and that was my primary reason for going to third-party repair.
    I told him I would be patient even if it took time for him to fix it because I don't plan on paying Apple premium to fix my computer. At this point it was not personal between me and apple or repair franchise.
     He warned me that it might be they were going through a stage where they were going from a franchise location to a corporate location at this franchise. I said that was okay as long as he could give me updates on the status of my repair.
    I told him my intent to send the device off to them if I could not fix it with a simple screen swap and I left the vacation with my computer.

On Tuesday April 13th I went to uBreakiFix because when I had swept up the screen the backlight would still not turn on but this display was still working which made me think it was a motherboard issue. The likelihood that both screens were had a bad back light was unlikely considering that theme replacement screen came from like fix it a very well-known company.
    I gave this third-party repair franchise location at the time my computer any box with all but four of the bottom screws in it and the rest of the screws were in a bag. My power supply for the laptop secondary original display that also didn't work for diagnosing purposes. When I gave them my computer oh, they said that it had to be sent off to another place where they had centralized repair is going on for more advanced issues.

On April 27th after many attempts of trying to call them and calling them on a regular basis anyway they were not picking up. I reached out via Twitter to they're handle and ask them why it was taking so long with a censored photo my receipt pointing out that it had been over a month and I wasn't able to get into contact with them.
    I was given the customer care number to reach out to them and they did not have the right number apparently as easily switch from franchise corporate-owned they didn't pay for the number rights to the location so I had to use an alternative number they gave me.

On Saturday June 19th I went to the franchise location that had my computer and asked for it back when they asked why I said it was because they hadn't been contacting me regarding updates when I would call up there every once or two weeks. Second one according to the last people I called they said that the last time any work had been done any service record have been acknowledged was in April early April.
    My computer has been sitting in the back of the store after having attempting a repair in swapping out the screens only to find that it wasn't the screen at the service center and then being unable to locate the problem. they swapped the motherboard another to anouther motherboard and did not check if that motherboard was good as I would find out later. They also did not try to swap it with a third screen or test one of my screens on a donor bass to test if it was my motherboard or the actual backlight of either of the displays that I had.

On Tuesday June 29th I took my computer to Micro Center and got it repaired officially by the Apple Certified Technician people and it was as it turned out that I may have gotten a bad part. Replacement display I got had a dead backlight but I no longer had the original motherboard so I can't crew that wasn't the motherboard killing the backlight. I can only prove that in the end the backlight that was in both my original and the replacement display was broken or burned out.
    They informed me that furthermore the motherboard was damaged in such a way that the camera wasn't working among other things.
    The backlight on the keyboard which was working in the beginning and was able to be adjusted was Now not working and the right speaker for some reason Microcenter had left unplugged. It doesn't bother me it's a 10-minute fix. What bothered me why is that I could not use any video chat functionality because there was no camera and rather than taking parts from the good motherboard and putting them on to the bad motherboard so that the special serial code didn't change they did a hole mother board swap.
    In 2015 this laptop was produced without the Apple M1 chip. The replacement motherboard also did not have the Apple M1 chip. However your Apple ID is linked to your motherboards serial number for reasons. As a result of their method I had to login into anouther apple computer to confirm my account from their using a text message and it then confirm on my laptop which now was very confused. The only reason why what I did work was because before all of his I could set up my phone to receive texts a confirmation from Apple what's an alternative.
    As a result it was recommended by the people at Microcenter to get a new motherboard into go buy one online Again part number was given to me this time I went back to the franchise location ask them to fix their screw up.
    Picked up on Friday July 9th.

On Wednesday July 14th, I gave the third-party repair now corporate site the benefit of the doubt in regards to the motherboard not being good because they couldn't have possibly known if they didn't have a second computer to test with or for other reasons and so I simply asked them to fix their mistake.
    They try to pass the buck on to me and claimed I had denied service to them. I pointed out that they hadn't done anything to the computer for a month-and-a-half from early April and that I had to come pick it up from them because they didn't tell me that the computer wasn't able to be fixed by them or give me any update as to why they couldn't fix it right now. This combined with knowledge that they with switching over to a corporate structure I gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked that they please fix it because it was their mistake then and I just want to get it fixed please.
    And yes at this point my temper was starting to flare and I was getting very frustrated with them. They accepted that and said that they would need to do over another assessment because technically somebody else had touched it and I was fine with that small charge of money in order to get it fixed and they took my computer back again.

On Monday August 16th I picked up the computer after having been told that it was ready to be picked up two days ago during the weekend. I have not called them once and they never called me except to confirm that I wanted to have the motherboard fixed when they confirmed (again) that the motherboard was the problem.
    When I got my computer back it still did not have any of the bottom screws because they were lost the first time I gave him to this franchise location except for but only four of them.... which means that the bottom does not seal and you can actually push a piece of paper between the aluminum.
    Oh yeah they also did not fix the backlight on the keyboard which is a problem because I need that light to type in the dark.
    The backlight is fixed the right speaker is plugged in again the display can brighten and dim. The trackpad works and the battery charges. I thought that they screwed up the placement of the charger but they actually just for some reason left a random capacitor or resistor whatever Buzz in the charging port which got in the way and I just pulled that out because it why is that magnetically sticking inside of the computers side of this.(look up a photo of the Apple charger called magsafe 1 or 2)... amateur but not very destructive so yeah.
    I am pretty sure that they changed the motherboard again so it's a difference here in the morning I have to go through that process again. They also did something? When I push underneath the bottom right side of the computer I hear the fan level clearly there is something in there that is causing it to brother and I can't pick up the computer flat with my hand because just the weight of computer so will cause the fan to rub only on the right side.

 I want to buy a desktop Apple computer of the M1 Apple chip design. In order to do that I need to sell my current computer. Cuz Apple force me to use their certified repair program I want to sell my computer for charity and give the proceeds to someone like rossmann repair. This way it maximizes the amount of Apple Computers out there that Apple doesn't get a profit from. In order for me to recycle the laptop for money or to sell it thru the Apple refurbishment program I need it to be one hundred percent working and I want it to be one hundred percent working anyway if I sell it to someone other than Apple. So I'm definitely not going to send it back to this franchise location again because..... Trust.....
    This is not on here is an ad to sell the laptop. This is here so that I can ask what should I do about the bottom of the laptop that currently needs screws put in it and backlight on the keyboard not working in order for me to have peace of mind to sell it to someone.

I am less than 30 and have never tried to reclaim money from people who fail to provide me the repair service that they promised. Furthermore they charged me $300ish to actually get my laptop back which as a reminder Not only was it not in working condition it was their mistake to begin with because they threw out my old motherboard and it didn't just swap components over one at a time.

Needless to say, there is a lot of family drama, and the executor has been extremely hostile to one family member (a beneficiary) in particular (not myself) for personal reasons. The executor has threatened this beneficiary with owing legal fees every time the executor seeks advice against the beneficiary from the probate lawyer that was hired shortly after my grandmother passed. The beneficiary who is being threatened with these fees has not once spoken to this lawyer.

Is this legal? Shouldn’t the executor disperse funds to all beneficiaries at the same time? How can someone be charged for legal fees if they haven’t actually hired a lawyer themselves or pursued any action in court?

At every other job that I've worked, once I reached 8 hours, I would start accumulating overtime pay. However, with my job now, I no longer accumulate overtime pay UNTIL I reach 40 hours in a work week. Then, every hour after 40 is counted as overtime. If I work 10 hours on a Monday, they are all counted as regular time. Am I being paid properly? Just something I want to be sure about.

There's nothing in my employment paperwork that describes any exempt status, I am a hourly, non salary employee.

My friend's dad is also suing me for causing him emotional distress by implying that he was the reason my friend left and demanding money. That sounds like I was extortioning him, which I wasn't! He stole a lot of the cash my friend was hiding for her escape, so I told him taking her money would further damage his relationship with her and suggested he give the money back (to *her* not me). He's also saying that I'm harassing the family.

My great great great grandparents bought several plots of land and distributed the land to all their children so the whole family can grow up together. My grandparents inherited the land and split their land evenly to distribute to their own children. My grandma had sold the land and house to my mom for $5 so my mom would have a place to raise us three girls. My grandma had sold the house to my mom months after my mom got divorced.

During that time, my cousin (my dad's nephew) liked my mom in a romantic way and told her he would help raise us. He never helped raised us girls financially since he said he's not our dad. IF we wanted anything or needed anything, our mom paid everything for us on her own. My mom didn't like our cousin that way and never wanted to get married again. She didn't get married to him but when she got sick, he claimed her under his taxes and the tax lady made a mistake saying they were married which screwed her up even further because she didn't qualify for any financial assistance due to my cousin's paychecks. He contributed little to nothing during her sickness and got a girlfriend a month after my mom's passing.

He has always been verbally abusive, physically abusive to his sons. Growing up he would always tell my mom that this was his house and everything belonged to him while he broke stuff. His argument was that he paid all the bills and fixed up the house. I use to go weeks eating little to no food because he would tell ask me why was I eating when all i did was sleep and go to school. He verbally abused me until I moved out. I still have issues of believing i'm a burden and easily replaceable due to his verbal abuse. He physically and verbally abused both of his sons until they moved out.

There was a loan on the house twice. One loan was due to my mom needing money to bring step dad's family from Mexico here legally and the second loan was because my half brother (his son/mom's son) was hospitalized due to a suicide attempt. The loan was in my step dad and mom's name.

One of my  half brother's (his son/mom's son) claims our mom left the house to him and he had put the house deed under his name a day before she passed away. I'm hearing from my half brothers that our cousin plans to sell the house and throw out our mom's stuff. It has been three years since she passed. Last time I asked him if he was going to sell the house, he said no.

All 5 of us kids don't want him to sell the house. I don't care which sibling it goes to. I'm completely ok with it going to my brother since my sisters already have a home of their own. We want to keep it in our family but step dad doesn't want to sell to us. Our mom was sick and on strong cancer medication weeks before her passing. The girlfriend is encouraging him to sell our mom's house and get rid of her stuff.

Is there anything we can do? What are our options? How do we even go about this?

The bumper and taillight were damaged and some slight scratches on the quarter panel. The bus driver reported the accident to the police who contacted her. She got the police report. 

She did not want to pay the deductible (1k) towards her own insurance (something about the deductible not being guaranteed to be reimbursed?) so she submitted the police report to the  the bus company to file a claim towards their insurance. It took weeks to get responses from the bus company’s insurance with lots of chasing up just to get her claim through, but in the end an adjuster came, did the estimate, and a check was cut. The check was deposited but held in escrow.

The car was then taken to a reputable body shop who estimated much higher (+1k) for repairs. They said if it was through insurance that they would work with them to adjust the claim and that they would pay whatever the additional cost was. They claimed that it was easy to work with and had worked with the bus company’s insurance before. They were adamant that she was already on the insurance route and that it was dimly a matter of adjusting the claim. So with that understanding the car was scheduled at the shop to get repaired. 

Another three weeks have gone by and the car which has been fixed will not be released by the shop on the count that the insurance has not paid the extra amount needed. They said this is typical for the business. From my friends perspective she is being victimized since they are the ones that claimed they would work with the insurance. It’s not her fault that they did the work without securing the funds. I think the situation I simple and she’s absolutely being wronged here. 6 weeks is too long for a bumper and taillight repair.

Day #3: I start my shift and I get a harsh verbal warning from my manager because the cleaner has reported me for harassment. I am told that what I did was wrong, and that I am no longer to make eye contact with her or talk to her. If it happens again the higher ups get involved and I could lose my job. I was also told that after the incident I later glared at her as I was walking past her (yes I did make eye contact, and yes I was unhappy, so I'm not gonna smile and be cheery after she ruined my night by yelling at me and making accusations against me). So, presumably, ""if it happens again"" could include making eye contact and having her interpret that as harassment. I was also told that if something makes someone feel uncomfortable, that is harassment - that part of it is about how they feel, not about the actual actions that took place. So it doesn't matter that she didn't communicate her discomfort with me because ""she was in shock.""  
  
I am in a union. The cleaners are not, and are a third party contracted company.

I do not know much about tenant-landlord rights and responsibilities and am looking for general advice here. 

I have recently transferred units into a new apartment with X property management. I have been living in my new apartment for almost a week. Today, 8-16-2021 as I got home from work as a Kitchen Manager about 7pm and decided I wanted to wash my clothes to prevent grease stains from staining my dress blouse. Because my new apartment door doesn’t fit right, I am unable to lock the deadbolt, but did lock the bottom one. (I know this for a fact, because it takes both hands to do it. One to turn the lock and the other to lift the weight of the door so the bar slides into place.) After locking my door I remove my dirty clothes and proceed to place them in the washer which is located in the common area right by my front door. Having done that, and being stark naked I walk over to my living room where I had some folded laundry from the day before. Without much time to do anything else but walk over to my laundry basket, my locked front door is opened without a knock, by a rough looking stranger. I do not know this man personally, however he is wearing a bright green shirt I do know to be a part of an amateur cleaning/flipping team for apartment turn-overs hired by my complex. I shockingly say “Excuse me!” And without an explanation as to why this man has entered my unit, he leaves. I am utterly mortified, having just been exposed to a man in the privacy of my own home, and horrified that this man on the cleaning team (made of generally sketchy looking people working for temporary living accommodations) had unsupervised access to my unit and belongings, and was able to walk-in on me undressed as a woman alone in my home. I check my emails thinking I have missed an important notice of entry, but have received none. I have not placed any maintenance orders, I have no emergency repair services needed on my unit, it was well after X property management’s business hours, so I can confirm they were not there to show my unit or do any cleaning/upkeep. The last email I have from them is dated 7/26/2021 saying that after 8/10/2021 my move-in period, they will not be reentering my unit for any cleaning or inspections. I am not sure if this constitutes illegal entry, because Missouri laws are vague and do not define cause for entry. Does this also apply when it was not my landlord who entered my unit without notice but some random with a key who was unsupervised? I feel very distraught, unsafe, and no longer secure. I am concerned that there have been instances where I have not been home and people have been in my home without my knowledge or consent. My neighbor recently mentioned that he installed cameras and is contacting his own lawyer after finding people entering his apartment and using his stuff when he wasn’t home. At first I thought he was paranoid but now I am also concerned, having just been walked in on. 

What are my rights here and what is it recommended that I do in this situation? I’m not able to contact my complex because it’s after hours and I’ve actually been trying to get ahold of them the past few days about an unrelated issue and my calls are getting forwarded to voicemail and not returned.",legaladvice,Third party random hired by my property manager entered my locked apartment while I was naked WITHOUT notice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5wluv/third_party_random_hired_by_my_property_manager/

Almost 6 years ago I designed a logo for a local business. The client was someone that I had known since I was pretty young, so I trusted him. He agreed he would pay me $150 for a logo design (I have all this in writing btw)  


I created a bunch of designs to show him. I sent him a pdf with logo options. He told me they like one of the logos but then I never heard back about it, so I thought maybe they decided to go with a different designer, I let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, just the other day, I was driving down the street where the business is located and noticed that they are using the logo I designed, which I was never paid for.  The logo is printed right on the door of the business.

Legally, that logo is my intellectual property and they have been using it for 6 years now. They only had to pay me $150 for my service but they  failed to do so. I have all the records of our conversations and I still have copies of all the original designs I created for them.

No invoice, no contract, nothing and he put a lien on my house. What do I do now?

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of this year a rental property experienced a backed up drain that flooded one of the bathrooms in the house. A plumber was called to find the cause of the backup and provide quotes to fix the root cause. The plumber recommended a mitigation service to check the bathroom for mold as it had been wet for over a day and he wanted to make sure everything was dry in the house while he worked on the underlying cause. As far as I can tell, the plumber is NOT affiliated with the mitigation contractor.

SO I call the mitigation contractor, we'll call him Ted (not his real name), evaluated the situation and agreed to do the work. They said that they do this kind of stuff all the time and will collect payment through insurance and that I would not have to pay anything out of pocket. No contract was signed. No invoice was given for the work. To this date, no paperwork has been provided save for the Mechanics Lien document that arrived at my house by certified mail from their attorney.

On Monday, Jan 11th 2021, Ted provided 6 industrial fans at the property to dry out the bathroom. Other than checking the wall for moisture with a probe, no additional work was done. Drywall didn't have to come down, nothing. The fans remained on at the property for 7 days. Ted collected the fans on January 18th 2021 and I didn't hear from him again for several months. I never signed anything and my tenant insists he didn't either.

Sometime in April, Ted contacts me regarding my insurance information. I give him the insurance info and initiate the claims process. Rob said he would handle the rest. After several weeks Rob says that insurance refuses to work with him and that I needed to step in and talk to them on his behalf. I was not comfortable doing this and still do not have an invoice so I have no made any additional appeals to insurance.

I received the mechanics lien on July 20th, 2021 asking for the absurd amount of $35000. Where he got this figure from is beyond me for the amount of work that was provided.

I have since retained a lawyer and he's helping me respond but I just want to hedge my bets a bit. It is my understanding that a ""Preliminary Notice"" needs to be served for a Mechanics Lien. Furthermore, a Mechanics Lien must be served within 90 days of job completion. **Given that the job was completed on January 18th and I did not receive a Preliminary Notice NOR was the Lien filed within 90-days - does that make the Lien invalid?** How do I go about invalidating the Lien because I checked the public records and the Lien is apparently there.

I also don't have his contractor license number and it is my understanding that unlicensed contractors are not allowed to file a Lien, at least not a valid one.

&amp;#x200B;

We sought treatment at a chiropractor that we were sent to from the urgent care we visited shortly afterward.  This chiropractor performed several services that were seemingly unrelated to the injuries that left us both with medical liens placed.  None of the injuries nor treatments could be characterized as severe. 
 
The at-fault driver's insurance company settled the claim with us in July 2020 for amounts above the liens in both cases.  However, being completely inexperienced with this, we errantly spent the money, falsely believing that this settlement was for the pain-and-suffering and loss of work.  We assumed that the at-fault party's insurance company would work directly with the medical provider to pay out for services related to our care. 
 
The medical provider is seeking to recover their medical lien now and are, rather expectedly, threatening interest accrual and possible legal action.  We have not contacted the provider as of yet to negotiate the terms of the lien post-hoc.  I do believe they were previously agreed to at the time of service.  Once again, ignorance prevailed. 
 
What options are we looking at, if any?  Will the lien expire?  Can we negotiate at this late stage?  Could they legally sue us individually, accrue interest, or both?  Should we take the loss and expiate the liens?

I wanted to know if that was actually allowed? It's based on a true story, but I'm not really sure on the legality of being able to use the play. It's not really about the play, more so that they're actors and there's a lot of thematic parallels to the play. 

The main (pun intended) part of the concern I have is a part of my book where I have the characters acting out a specific part of a scene. The following is the only time I ever actually have a part of the play acted out in any meaningful way:

 

*Robert and Pat did a killer job in their scene. I peeked through the curtain while we were backstage, trying to get a good view.*

*“Danny! I didn’t even rec-” Pat as Hope said.*

*“I know,” Robert as Danny replied.*

*“I… I didn’t even recognize you…”  She continued.*

*“I know,” He replied,*

*“You’re so…” She repeated,*

*“I know,” He repeated,* 

*“Small…” She finished. Her shoulders slumped with the word, as if the word was the last of the air in a balloon. I could only see them from the rear stage right side of the theater, but I could tell the look on Pat’s face since I’d seen the scene a million times. She had this defeated look to her. One that told so many emotions. Her eyes were sad and devoid at the same time. The muscles around her mouth and her jowls danced with the blocking of the script as if they were meant to be. It was a perfect synergy. I felt myself tear up. I couldn’t help but feel myself in Danny’s shoes. Then I felt a slight rage build up.* 

The book otherwise uses the play as a setting, and a venue for the characters to meet and yatta yatta. I'm not too worried about including it and acknowledging its existence, but I am concerned about the direct quotations in this small part. I want to get into contact with the author and see if he is okay with it, however I'm having difficulties doing that, and wanted to make sure I could actually do this.

- charge the client for a month of my salary, without paying me (Yes. They kept it.)

-LIE about them operating in our hometown when they actually moved to another state. (The office is empty, yet the clients do not know about it.)

- Have not responded nor followed up with staff for MONTHS. Suddenly asking staff to send them our client's money to their foreign new home address.
- the ""office"" is completely empty and no client knows they've abandoned the office
- The forbid me to have my asperger therapy. 

Now, they suspended me without pay for 3 days for an autism-melt down I had (due to such hostil enviroment and moral dilemas.) Because I did not fill out a report due the  day my doctor sent me to intense In-patient Treatment. She wrote a medical excuse and they did not care, stating I needed to give 2 weeks notice and MAYBE get approved (because... that's how autism meltdowns work... I can program them 2 weeks in advance.) 

What should I do!? Yes! I could quit. But I don't want to be pushed out a job I love ( client. Not the agency.) I have not seen this people for a YEAR. 

I know I ranted for a bit. 

But how come I get 3 days without pay for something I could not complete because my brain LITERALLY shut down (keep in mind I have a psychiatrist note.)

From that point until early 2018, I never missed a single HOA payment. This was because I always set my payments on auto so that I don't have to worry about it. 

I missed a payment in 2018 due to HOA switching to a new online system (they waived the late fee). Now once again I was on automatic payments. First month of 2020, the monthly fees increased, and so a balance started accumulating. I stopped the auto payments and started making payments manually. By May I had missed a payment and I asked the HOA for clarification on the payments and to see how much of the total was late fees vs my dues. In hindsight, my mistake was stopping auto payments as that allowed the HOA to keep stacking up late fees. I was also traveling and missed payments here and there (for years I never had to worry about manually making this payment). The whole time though, I was trying to reach someone in the HOA to give me a breakdown of late fees vs monthly dues, which I was never provided. Since I was busy with so much other shit, I would only remember about the HOA fee mess when they would send me a letter, and I would completely forget about it once I don't hear back from them until the next letter. This resulted in me accumulating close to a hundred dollars in late fees. I continued making payments, but not the full amount as I wanted to know how much late fees I had stacked up.

I reached out to the HOA and they have basically told me they cant remove any more than 2 late fees (that too only because of covid). I asked them to reconsider due to my payment history and the circumstances but they essentially told me they would send me to a debt collector if I didn't pay. This is also when they finally sent me a breakdown of my payments which is the reason why I was hesitant to make payments. If they sent me this the first time I asked, I would have seen exactly what was  going on.

I know this is essentially on me as I am responsible for my payments but can't they make exceptions? Clearly I have been paying my dues regularly for 7 years so why can't they budge? They told me they have ""bills to pay"" and that just sounds like horseshit. They  can't be banking on late fees to pay bills...",legaladvice,Dealing with a terrible HOA that won't waive late fees,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5vgzw/dealing_with_a_terrible_hoa_that_wont_waive_late/

3 months ago construction started at an intersection I commonly go through as I am a delivery driver and it is the closest intersection to my workplace. I was unaware left turns were prohibited, made a prohibited turn, and got pulled over.

Here is where the fishy stuff starts.

As the cop was handing me a citation, he told me ""Im letting you off with a warning, but unfortunately Im going to have to give you a citation"", which is very contradicting. As it was my first time being pulled over I just went with it because Im not sure what normally happens.

So, I just wanted to get it over with and pay the $120 fine, so I went to the court, then to the court clerk, handed her the money and the ticket, and she told me ""no, don't pay it, your insurance rates will go up, fight it, they are being very lenient"" and got the doorman to assist me with how I should go about doing that, which he recommended writing a letter.

The next day I leave a letter in the box at the court, which is what I was told to do.

A few months go by with no response, I figured the case was dropped, but today I get a letter saying I had a court appearance on 8-4-2021, which I was never made aware of, I thoroughly check my mail. Now they are asking for $170.

tl;dr: I was completely willing to pay a $120 fine, court clerk told me not to due to interest rates going up, suggested I fight the ticket, now they are asking for $170.

I am asking you fine people for some advice.   


I received unemployment benefits in California last year. At the beginning of this year I received a letter informing me that I need to submit additional proof of identity or the claims would be retroactively classified as overpayment. I submitted everything and never received a response.   


A few weeks after that I received a Notice of Determination saying that I was not eligible to receive UI benefits. I was able to appeal this decision and I did.   


Today I received a Final Collection Notice.

I want to get revenge on the porch pirate and I get that booby traps that cause harm (even temporary) are off the table, but annoyance/displeasure isn't right? And what are the limitations. (And can I seriously not chase after them if I see them running away with my package? Am I supposed to just kindly ask them to please put it down? Am I not allowed to so much as touch them even if they are actively stealing my property?)

My initial though is to fill a big box with bricks, because that would surely be annoying if they dragged it back to their apartment just to find out it's bricks. I assume that if they throw out their back that that's on them right? It's very obvious that it's heavy within a fraction of a second and there are way too many other things they can throw out their backs on if they wanted to for that to be a legal grounds to sue. If that's the case I could sue my neighbor by trying to lift their car.

My next thought was a ""stink bomb"" by spraying down the bricks in the box with something smelly or unpleasant like pepper spray/capsaicin, its not like I'm spraying them in the face and the worse case would be that their nose would sting and maybe their eyes would water. Surely something really smelly (that they stole) would not be legal grounds to sue.

I've heard that glitter would be a bad idea because they could snort it and hurt their lungs or get it in their eye, but what about dye packs, flour, or popping a bag of oil (I'd really like to do itching powder but I can see how that's getting off limits)?

I'm obviously nervous because this is so much money to me (I've already carefully weighed the financial intelligence of this, it's a good deal; she's letting me buy it for $8K less than the KBB because she can't afford the payments and already has a 2nd vehicle).

I've never bought a car if the title wasn't available to hand over immediately.

She has been married for 4 years and her new husband (according to the stories she's been telling me for years) is going through a messy divorce, apparently the ex-wife is a monster who stole my mom's SSN to open a credit card in her name, took the husband's house, etc. The husband is supposedly going through bankruptcy but my mom swears that ex-wife doesn't have access to her (my mom's) accounts because ""I'm listed as power of attorney"" somewhere. I'm worried that if i transfer my money to my mom's account for the car, it will be snatched away before the loan can be paid off. My mom says (1) this can't happen and (2) it wouldn't because she will pay off the loan immediately. Also supposedly she has another $15K to pay me if that should happen. I'm generally sketched out.

My mom is a good person overall but very scatterbrained and opaque. She has been known to be evasive and manipulative but at other times extremely kind. She just bought my sister a $700 computer. I think she is genuinely trying to do me a favor by selling me a nice newer car at a discount because mine is really old. But I'm also wondering what angles to be weary of.

I wanted to write her a check so i would have a physical record / memo line of the payment - offered a cashier's check or a personal check + allowing her to view the balance of my bank account before cashing it - but she said she doesn't want to do either since it will generate a tax liability for her (she hasn't explained why a wire wouldn't). 

My friend suggested i just pay off the loan directly instead of giving her the money in the middle. She said no, this wouldn't work because it would generate more taxes (??) and/or lower her credit score because she's not the one paying it (???).

We have a good relationship overall, she definitely wouldn't change her mind or bounce or anything but she is pretty erratic/idiosyncratic, and I'm naturally suspicious when it comes to money. I had to fight tooth and nail to get out of my family's general financial hole and sure as hell don't wanna risk anything.

1) Should i be worried about her husband's bankruptcy?
2) is it legit to wire money with the promise of getting the title after? I would never do this with a stranger 
3) what kind of document(s) would be wise or appropriate to write up? (before or after sending money) 
4) I know wires are sketchy in general, would prefer to avoid. Why is she so set against a check, direct payment to the bank etc? are her statements true?
5) Should i be worried about taxes and if so what's the best route

I am posting because I believe I have been neglected by my family since I was a child. I was bullied, name called, laughed at, made fun of, taunted etc... emotionally neglected by my brother. My mother would scream and yell at me everything I will do wrong as if it were to let me be safe and do the right thing when performing any action she had told me to do. All throughout gradeschool I would never shower, brush my teeth, talk, smile, engage in conversation etc. I've had some days at school where my period blood would go through my pants and be visible on the classroom chair. No one not even the teachers would tell me a thing. My mother didn't bring up the conversation even when she did the laundry that same day. Not even in elementary when my grades would start to decline. I firmly believe the school tried to cover me up by faking my grades because I did so much to show my emotional state but no one bothered to help. One day my mom asked if I washed my hair and she yelled at me so she can check my hair. There was a lot of dandruff and she yelled at me and kept going through the hair and yelled telling my older sister to look at how nasty my hair was. My older sister would look with disgust. My mom yelled at me to take a shower with my hair all messy because she was showing my sister.  When I had gotten my first period my mom simply asked if I knew how to use feminine wipes which I said yes to. She didn't tell me anything else and left me alone to use google so I can know what's going on. When I was around the age of seventeen or eighteen I wanted my mom to take me to the obgyn office because of something I thought was wrong with me. She took me and I didn't want her to accompany me to see the gyno. the doctor prescribed me birth control pills to balance my hormones a bit since she saw my concern and it seemed like an easy fixable issue. My mom asked what happened and I told her everything was fine and she was frustrated. I went to the pharmacy and asked to pickup. They said they didn't receive the birth control. Until two days before my follow-up I look in my parent's restroom and there they were. I didn't ask my mom because I was scared and I thought for sure she would tell me that the pharmacy finally got the pills. She didn't. Instead when I decide to bring my mom to see the gyno with me when asked by the doctor my mom simply asked what pills and the doctor explained and my mom told her we never got those pills. I just told the doctor I never received them scared out of my mind. We went into the car to leave and my mom threw a fit at me. I didn't know until I was asked by the pharmacy if I wanted to get notified of my meds through phone that my mother knew the birth control pills were at the pharmacy because she put her number as the one to know when the meds are ready. My sister was never comforting she was always in her room and rarely got out to eat. She would play the same role my brother would but more terrifying. In the summer break in between freshman and sophomore year I noticed while I stay laying in my bed everyday as I do every year I'm losing sleep. I told my mother and she yelled at me to stay in my bed and go to sleep like I always do. I spent a year with no sleep and spent my entire sophomore year with insomnia until I had my psychosis and attempted suicide. My mother still denied that I was happy and normal when asked by the doctor if everything was okay before I started hearing voices. I want to take my life back but now it feels like it's too late and I've missed out on so many critical developmental stages of my life and have to stay constantly dependant on my parents for insurance housing etc. Even trying to get a driver's license that I still don't have is harder with them. They told me I can't and shouldn't and don't need a license because they don't want to pay for the insurance. My dad even asked me in the line waiting for my driving appointment with the DMV if they'll let me drive with my disability. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and I had never needed the government's assistance or even qualified for disability. I have even gotten other diagnosis completely different from schizophrenia at an inpatient hospital. Please help me figure out what to do in this situation in the state of Texas.

This is also my first post here so I am trying my best to stick to community rules, please let me know if I am in any violation.

A few months ago, a partner at my current employer, Company A, left to go to Company B, a competitor. Fast forward, a few others and I were reached out to by Company B's recruiter for an opportunity. All of us took the call and decided it was a great career move and that we wanted to pursue the opportunity. I was the last of the three to be reached out to, hence my last round of interviews were just after the other two had put in their two weeks notice. The day prior to receiving my offer letter, Company A sent a cease and desist to Company B detailing that the partner had violated his non-solicit agreement and should no longer continue recruiting from Company A.

After about a week of internal discussion, Company B feels that they would not win a legal battle over this and have told me that they cannot extend me an offer *while still employed at Company A.* The caveat being that on a phone call, their recruiter told me specifically they can extend me an offer should I no longer be employed at Company A. Sparing details, I am very very close with the two people who have already left and the partner himself and have also heard that I am the #1 candidate and that they had zero doubts whatsoever in my qualifications and fit on the team.

Yes I know this would be a very risky thing to do, but I am considering because I am not only extremely excited about this role but am further extremely unhappy with my current role, mainly the leadership, the culture, and how many other coworkers conduct themselves.

How little detail do I have to stick by in order to cover my own ass, should I choose to quit and be ""unemployed""?

I have a 13 year old child who's mother I pay $233/month.  I recently had another child with another woman in another state.  She offered to skip the courtroom process if I pay her $400/month.  I recently qualified for 70% disability through the VA (about $1400/month and my only income).  The VA is expected to make a determination as to weather I am 100% disabled (mental health) which would pay about $3200/month.  So I guess my question is,  should I settle with the mother out of court or is the court likely to come after my disability benefits?  Would the courts decision on my second child affect the court ordered payments of my first child?  Does the income of baby momma #2 (90k/year) have any impact on how the court would come after me for payment?

I’ll try and keep this brief. I co-wrote a song that got released by a major artist through a label. I signed off on a contract that states I get 4% of the royalties for this track. The song has amassed 60 million streams on Spotify alone.

I know for a fact that Spotify pays out $0.003 - $0.005 per stream based on several factors:

1) all online articles by legitimate sources claim Spotify pays out $0.003 - $0.005 per stream. 

2) I have released several songs independently through distrokid and have personally confirmed Spotify is paying me at least $0.003 on average per stream

3) several of my independent musician friends claim and have proven to me Spotify pays them $3-4k per million streams (= $0.003-0.004 per stream)

Doing the math shows the label owes me (0.003)x(60,000,000)x(4%) = $9,600 from spotify royalties alone. However they have only paid me $2,000 in total royalties from all sources. When I questioned a representative at the label they are claiming the song is getting $0.0006 per stream from Spotify which is why my payout is so low. 

Problem is that I have yet to find a single source confirming Spotify has ever paid such a low payout. I have article sources, personal evidence, and witness testimonials that all indicate Spotify pays well above this rate. This makes me believe the label is under reporting and under paying the revenue owed to me.

Should I request an audit? How would I do this? Should I talk to a lawyer? I am in Los Angeles, CA.",legaladvice,Label underpaying my royalty share and claiming absurdly low Spotify payout,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5u5md/label_underpaying_my_royalty_share_and_claiming/

Days passed and after checking tracking the DHL status said the package hadn't even been collected yet. I thought perhaps the courier had never come, so went down to the mailroom to check, and lo and behold, they don't have my package anymore. I asked to see the proof of pickup signature and the mailroom had no idea what I was talking about and didn't have the slip anymore either. They also apparently don't keep their own log of outbound packages so they have no way to confirm what happened.

I was hoping there was just a lag in DHL's system, so gave it a few more weeks. It has now been a full month, and DHL confirms they never collected my package. The building insists to me they must have, since they don't have it anymore, but they also can't prove anything because they don't have the courier signature or keep their own records.

I was just ending my lease and moved out before the new company came in. 

I have signed,started and finished 2 new lease contracts with 2 separate apartment complexes since then with no issues since then. 

About 7 months ago I put an application in for a new place but was quickly denied due to several evictions placed against me from the original complex. 3 evictions for 3 consecutive months. Evicted in February, evicted in March and once again evicted in April. Not sure how I can be evicted from a place that evicted me the previous month and so forth but that's what I was up against. 

Since the apartment complex is no longer in business with no representing attorney and no front desk or management to contact it has been impossible to show any kind of proof that I was not evicted. 

I decided to just bite the bullet instead of exhausting myself fighting a seemingly impossible battle and paid a bit over $3k  to the collection agency to show proof that the account has been relieved and have this removed from my rental history/credit reports and finally move forward with my life. I was told by the collection agency as well as TransUnion/Equifax that it would be removed from my reports after 30 days. 

That was 7 months ago. I have spent hundreds on application fees, certified letters to the courts, thousands to an aggressive collector all to be repeatedly denied due to this same eviction. I contacted the collection agency and was told someone on their end didn't do their job and send off my proof of payment to the courts. Now I am being told it's going to take another 30 days minimum (most likely longer) for it to drop.

Basically we hired painters to paint the entire interior of our home. They said it would take a week (the house was empty) and would be $26k. A week goes by and they’re nowhere near done. They said they needed another week… you know where this is going. After the second week they’re at most 50% done.

Is there any world where they or their subcontractors have a case against us? I would welcome a suit from the contractor because I have plenty of text and email documentation of their unprofessionalism.

I paid first, last, and deposit up front. I was planning on continuing my lease, which my landlord was fine with, but they never brought a new lease to sign. I am/was renting a room in a 3 bedroom apartment. New roommates arrived in August whose lifestyles and values conflict completely my own, and I have decided to find new housing. 

According to a web search, in Florida, when a lease expires and is not renewed, and the tenant stays with the landlord's permission, then a month-to-month agreement becomes enforced. From there, 15 days notice must be given to either the tenant or landlord if one wishes to end the agreement (again, according to my cursory research). I gave 15 days written notice to my landlord, by dropping a letter off in their mailbox (I have a timestamped video showing the letter itself and me depositing it in their mailbox), letting them know that I would be vacating the apartment effective September 1st.

Initially they were fine with it, but they just texted me today saying that since they have not found a new tenant, I am on the hook for September's rent. I sent them screenshots showing my aforementioned findings on Florida's rules regarding lease expiration/month-to-month continuation/terminating the agreement. 

I suppose my question is, does my landlord have any recourse to make me pay any more rent? Also, since I provided ""last month's rent"" when I first signed the lease, should I not be refunded my August rent, seeing as I will be leaving by September?

As for my security deposit, according to my lease, if I do not provide 60 days notice that I will be leaving at the end of the term, then I forfeit my security deposit. Since I agreed to, and did, stay in the apartment for one month after the lease ended, does that clause still hold any water?

Basically, should I cut my losses vis a vis my ""last month's rent"" and security deposit, or do I have a case for getting those returned? And/or, have I made a mistake and will be on the hook for more rent?

We had a fire in Oct 2019 in Texas.  Both our rental insurance company, and the homeowners insurance company, sent fire investigators and insurance adjusters to the site. The takeaway from both insurances was that the fire was caused by a laptop charger. The house was a total loss- pretty much all possessions were destroyed or severely smoke damaged. After about 4-5 months of creating an itemized claim with all items in the house, we got paid 20k$ to replace all property, as we'd itemized about 45k$ worth of lost items, and the policy capped at 20k.

Now,  we received an ominous letter from the landlord requesting an additional 10k for ""lost rent and fire damages over what the homeowners insurance"" would cover.

The homeowner says that the renters insurance agency has not been quick to respond, so they are reaching out to us. This leads me to a couple questions:

Have they issued us a demand letter? Or just a request for funds?

[https://imgur.com/a/X3WXM4G](https://imgur.com/a/X3WXM4G)

Can we be directly sued  for the lost rent/damages over what homeowner insurance covers? I thought they would work with the renters insurance agency exclusively once we'd provided the homeowner that information. 

In my mind, this was all wrapped up 1.5 years ago. Any advice or help anyone could provide would be super appreciated. I can't really afford to pay this guy 10k, but I can afford 1500$ to hire a lawyer if this is an actual demand letter. This whole thing just doesn't really make sense to me.

I’m hoping to get some guidance regarding irrevocable trusts. 

To summarize - after being estranged from abusive family, my mother and I found, much to our surprise, that we were included in two estate trusts from her side of the family. 

We did retain a lawyer through a program we qualified for in hopes that the lawyers could be a buffer between us and the other estranged family mentioned in the trusts.

Our lawyer reached out for details/accountings/how we receive the payouts and was told it would be provided in less than 24 hours. After that, they never responded again and essentially pushed the clock on our time to contest both estates. 

Our only option presented to us was that we could “file to contest” or give up and hope they pay. We didn’t have the money to file so we are essentially here now.

I basically just want to know - is that true? Is that really how this works? They can just draw out the clock and push us to court and keep our inheritance if we can’t pay court fees to contest?

Or were we not properly informed of our options and there is a way to ensure the estates are followed. 

I really appreciate the advice/guidance and happy to provide additional details if that would help clarify. This is all in CA.

My sister 3 years ago got her children taken from her

I'll preface by saying that I'm in the state of Iowa.

I am a graphic designer at a printing firm in Des Moines. I've been here for about 10 years or so and while I love my team, my leaders, my production guys, and the owners of the company, I'm ready to move on. Most of what I design are political mailers and random things that businesses within the Des Moines area need (collateral, catalogues, signage, vehicle wraps, you name it). It's not bad, but I'm ready to start focusing on what I like to do and less on the wide breadth that this company does.

A university about 40 miles away is looking for a visual designer and I want to apply, but my covenant to not compete has me a little worried.

The recital states that ""### is a printing and graphic design business, with 2 locations in Des Moines, Iowa, United States."" I feel that's important to know. 

The considerations state that while employed, ""designers shall never, without the express and written approval of ###, render any design services, directly or indirectly, or act as a design expert for any person or firm for compensation while employed."" 

It also states that ""designers shall never, without the express and written consent of ###, engage in any design work or other activities competitive with or adverse to ###, whether alone, or as an independent contractor, partner, officer, director, employer, advisor, or shareholder.""

Upon termination of my employment, I'm bound by this covenant for a period of 1 year within 50 miles (this University's city falls within) or 2 years within 10 miles of Des Moines proper city limits (which basically excludes most of the metro area), punishable by 120% of my total earnings within the past 12 years.

We do not currently have this University as a client, as they have their own print facilities and do not print or design anything for the general public (nor take designs from anyone outside of the visual communication team). Additionally, what I would be doing is primarily digital design and layouts for their annual magazines and admissions publications. Some of what I do may end up printed, but 90% of it would not be.

Anyway, I apologize for the book, but I'm curious if this would be a breach of my covenant. 

I feel like it isn't, I'm not working for a competitor and I'm not taking clients (or IP) with me. My leaving might adversely affect them because they'd be down a junior designer. They currently have a few of us, but we've had strong workloads lately and that would happen even if I was leaving to go work at say, McDonalds.",legaladvice,Convenient Not to Compete Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5se9g/convenient_not_to_compete_advice/

I feel like I should start this from the beginning because there is a lot of crucial information here. So, I am 22 and I live in Ohio and I got a job with a family owned business as a 1099 contractor delivering appliances for Lowes. I heard about the job through a friend, and went in for an ""interview"" that included just the boss taking my license and social security card and making copies of them, telling me about the job and giving me a start date. I did NOT sign a contract as it was my first time being a contractor and wasn't aware that there would be 1099 forms to file (blame it on being young and inexperienced in a whole new line of work). I was paid per day, anywhere from 125-150 depending on if I was a helper or a driver. At first I was paid with a paper check and then I requested to be paid on cashapp as it was more convenient for both parties. *Now,* I did not start out as a driver, in-fact, I didn't start driving until about 2 months after I was employed. I have the texts from my boss stating that I was a driver for certain days. I should also mention, we are not driving regular sprinter vans, we are driving the big enterprise box trucks that are regulated through DOT. I do not have my DOT card, nor did the boss ever ask me for one and in-fact, only 1 driver in the entire team actually had a DOT card. Everything about the job is sketchy and ran weird. My boss would handle the maintainence on the trucks, handled the scheduling by texting us and letting us know if we were working the next day or not, and his wife handled the payroll. There's about 12-13 other people working there and both me and my friend had a problem working with a few of them as they would smoke weed on the truck and generally drove terribly. So, about a week ago I got into an accident where I turned and hit the roof of a closed down business with the side of my box truck, puncturing the box truck and causing a little bit of damage on the roof (I do have pictures of the damage). Now, I didn't figure it was a massive deal as it was an accident and sometimes things like that happen. So, I called and informed the boss and took pictures of everything, talked to the owner of the neighboring business to try and get contact information for the owner of the closed down business and in that time someone called the police which wasn't a big deal. I asked the boss for the insurance information, gave it to the police etc. and everything was all good. The boss said we'd not be working until he could get the truck fixed which was totally fine and understandable, however, when the time came for paychecks to come (this past friday on the 20th), he told me he wouldn't be paying me and informed me that I was never on the insurance as a driver as I was a ""Driver in training"", so he would be docking my pay for it.

The landlord had been complaining a while that property taxes had gone up, and he asked us to pay more in rent because he had seen similar places go for more than what we were paying. We said no. He has been raising the rent as much as he is legally allowed for two years until the pandemic put that on hold. We had been renting for 7 years when he said that he could no longer afford to rent the apartment and that him and his wife had decided to sell the apartment. He said we should expect realtors to come in the following week. We said okay and to give us proper notice (24 hrs) to see the suite. We also said we expect the 60 days from possession date. No response. 

Two weeks later and we haven’t heard anything from him. Then one day he says that now he will be moving into the apartment himself. He says him and his wife are having problems and he thought selling the apartment would alleviate that, but that they were now separating. I found this message odd mainly because he gave too much information. We didn’t need to know about his marital issues or the reason. Something about it was just so off. But he drops off the formal notice to end tenancy and so we make other living arrangements. 

A couple days after the 1st of the month he asked us for the last month’s rent (we had always paid right on time), to which we replied that when a tenant is being evicted they do not owe the last months rent (that’s true for where we are located). No response. I’m not sure if he didn’t know that or if he was hoping we didn’t know that. 

Fast forward a few months, and we can see clearly that this man is not living in the apartment. The apartment’s living room windows, kitchen room windows and balcony are all very visible to the main road. It’s one of the things I hated about living there. We see the same woman quite a bit and it’s not his wife. So at first I’m thinking, okay maybe this is his girlfriend? He did say his marriage was in disarray. But that doesn’t make sense because the day after we moved out we saw his wife in there cleaning. I don’t know many women that would clean an apartment for her husband and his girlfriend to move into. Then one day we saw a man, who was not the landlord, in the kitchen. We’ve driven by the landlord’s house a few times and his truck is there every single time. 

So it’s pretty clear at this point that we were evicted illegally, as the landlord is clearly not living there himself like he said. However proving this is another story. Any advice on what our next steps should be? The regulatory body we called were beyond unhelpful and said “can you get them to admit it?” Uh, I’m thinking not.

In summary, I was driving down a hill. The person in front of me abruptly stopped. Due to the downhill incline and very tight space, my car continued rolling forward after I hit the brakes immediately.  

Although it was a minor accident where the car was bumped, I was driving without insurance (in the state of Michigan). I now have to call the court, and I am not sure what to expect. I am worried about the financial situation since the lady was very dramatic and could say anything. I also am a college student and I am going back to school in less than 2 weeks. So, I don't know how the court will work (I go to school across the country).

Sidenote: my dad and I did stop at the lady's house and apologized. We offered to pay for any damage and gave her our contact if she needed anything.

I am not sure how to go about this situation since I am very stressed at the moment.

- My landlords have given me 60 days notice that they are selling the property, within the terms of the lease they have given me adequate notice. 
- There is no affordable housing near me at this time of year. Technically the notice the landlords gave ends three days before the federal eviction moratorium expires. 
- I am disabled, but am able to work and do not collect disability insurance. I can prove I am disabled via my clinicians. However, I do not make a lot of money. 
- I have been trying to buy a house and my landlords both know this and also dangled the purchase of this house to me like a carrot for four months, but rejected my offer last week because I asked for an inspection and told me to get out. So now I will not have enough time to buy a house because of their cruelty. 
- My landlord does happen to be an attorney.
- My landlord does not know that I am disabled. 
- There is a lot of community spread of COVID where I am living. I am vaccinated.

The advice I am seeking is if there is a way for me to remain in my current home a little bit longer based both on my being disabled and the eviction moratorium.

One of the large, beautiful fields leading to my property is currently being turned into an 85-home development. I don't have much of an issue with that, however the dirt work crew has me in a bind. 
On April 18th 2021, the crew was digging out the culvert alongside the road and they nicked our internet cable. It went out, a technician repaired it, nbd. On April 20th the crew decided that - even though there were already plans in place to properly relocate that cable - it was in their way and it had to go. So they literally ripped out 1/4 mile of cable. Obviously, if there is no cable to splice together, a technician cannot fix it, so my household has been without internet access since that day. 
I contacted engineers from the internet company, who told me they were going to fix it asap, and we should expect service to be restored in late July. They suggested that, in the meantime, I ask the supervisor of the construction company to get a hotspot for my home. I asked &amp; he gave me $600 in gift certificates and I bought a hotspot. That money has run out and I'll be paying out of pocket starting later this month. 
Late July came and went, so I called the engineers again and basically, since we are the only household affected, they completely forgot about us. They said they were waiting on the construction company to pay for damages caused, but they never paid. Since they never paid, the permits ran out and the project was put on the back burner and forgotten. Now they have to re-contract with construction co and re-file for permits from the power company, the city and the county. They told me not to expect service ""for the foreseeable future."" This is a problem. School is starting soon and my kids will need internet access. My business is online and it's been real hard keeping up with it. 
I ended up calling the supervisor again almost 2 weeks ago and explaining all this. He agreed to sending some more money so I can continue to pay for the hotspot but he never showed up. (Strike that, he called as I was typing this - he gave me another $500)

I have had issues with my power, water (it's been milky for weeks) and internet since construction started and every technician I've spoken to has told me that that site is unstructured chaos. Everything is going wrong. Not to mention that the dusty gravel road is constantly clogged with dump trucks and machinery and there isn't a single flagger around. You just have to cross your fingers and hope you don't get slammed with a swinging excavator bucket. 

Now, I realize I've gotten $1,100 that they did not have to give me. It all goes to paying for a 100gb hotspot - split between 6 people - and we have found it does not work for streaming, smart devices, the printer or gaming. Frivolous, sure, but we paid for all of those services and would like to use them. We pretty much use the hotspot to pay bills and for my husband to do bid pricing for work. 

So my question - is there anything I can do? Any action I can take? Or is this truly just a ""wait it out"" situation? What if the internet company forgets about us again? Everything was going just fine until they broke ground on that development and it's been constant frustration since then.",legaladvice,"A construction crew destroyed my internet cable, is there anything I can do about it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5rptg/a_construction_crew_destroyed_my_internet_cable/

Say there's some account with primary and contingent beneficiaries.

Primary Beneficiaries:

A - 50%

B - 50%

Contingent Beneficiaries:

C - 50%

D - 50%

I'm trying to understand how some scenarios would work if some of them die early. It's pretty clear when there's a single beneficiary in each class (primary-&gt;contingent-&gt;estate), but co-beneficiaries make it less clear.

1. Say A dies early. Would B inherit 50% and A's descendants 50%? Or would A's 50% transfer to the contingent beneficiaries C and D with 25% each? Or would B get 100% as the sole surviving primary beneficiary?
2. Here's another scenario. If A, B, and C die early, does D get 100%? Or does D get 50% and C's descendants get 50%? Or does C's portion go to the estate?
3. Does the type of account matter (life insurance vs. 401(k)s vs. IRA's vs. bank accounts with beneficiaries)?

I saw something about per stirpes vs. per capita distribution, but I'm not sure about all that.

I'm in the US. I'm wondering about this nationally, but I'm in Texas if the state matters.

Since I moved in last month our downstairs neighbor has had sporadic outbursts that include yelling, beating on walls, running around outside, etc. due to me and my girlfriend ""stomping"" despite our best efforts to move as quietly as humanly possible.

He has complained to the apartment manager multiple times, and after the second complaint I met with her and she said that he has mental issues (autism I think she stated) and that we won't get a lease violation due to his complaints since he is ""special.

We left for a weekend and came back yesterday and at every slight movement we make he beats on the ceiling (our floor) as hard as he can.  Last night I called the cops and they spoke to him and the beating stopped.

Fast forward to today, approximately 17:20 he begins beating on the ceiling and walls again very hard, upsetting all dogs in the complex and easily heard outside. I called the cops again and they came out and spoke with him and said I might have to go to the apartment manager and move to a different apartment since it seems she won't evict him or address the issue. 

This is obviously not the best scenario for us as I start school in the area next week and my girlfriend is working overtime every day this month.

I’ve never been arrested or given a ticket or been in any sort of trouble with police aside from these instances. 

Starting almost immediately after I got my license at 16 I have been pulled over multiple times for either no reason (as in, the officer truly never stated why I was pulled over) or for reasons that I don’t believe to be valid (crossing the double yellow line multiple times when I’m completely certain I didn’t, saying they thought my window tint was illegal when it isn’t). A lot of these stops result in my vehicle getting searched for the reason of probable cause because the officer claims to smell marijuana. There was also an instance where I got into a minor accident (it was my fault) while in another town that resulted in a search because I had left my car door slightly open while speaking with the officers and they said they should take me in for a DWI because they can smell weed. There is no possible way my car has ever smelled like marijuana, as I have never smoked marijuana in my car or even transported it in my car. I rarely smoke in general so my clothing and hair don’t smell like it’s lingering. I really pride myself in being a good and cautious driver, that one accident is the only one I’ve ever been in, and I’m terrified of a speeding ticket so I have never been one to speed. Also, none of these instances ever result in me getting any kind of ticket. 

What could be provoking the officers to pull me over? I don’t have crazy bumper stickers on my car and my appearance doesn’t stick out and I’m not a careless driver. I’m not perfect by any means of course, but the reasons I’ve been given for being pulled over don’t make sense to me and are never investigated any further, I’m pulled over, told I did something wrong, searched, and let go. The second time this happened I tried stating I wanted to wait for a warrant, but the cop shut me down saying that weed smell is probable cause.

I have muti personality disorder, due to the living conditions I was under I didnt know it till I was in foster care for a bit at 15-16 and saw a therapist who diagnosed me with it, she noted that its mostly under control with me as the prominent personality 90% of the time and that it's a coping mechanism I made to divide up my life to make things easier for myself to handle. The last few years it's been getting worst to the point where I struggle to stay in control under stress, and I didnt realize it but I became more and more dissociative as time went on.

Now I work at a hobby store, when I  got the job my mental health wasnt as bad as it is now. Recently a customer left an already purchased item in the store (about a month ago), I was interested in it and had inquired about it on a couple of occasions.

 Last weekend I took it to the break area to have a seat and look at it closer, I thought I put it back or left it on the table. To my suprise the following day I got text from the store group chat saying the person white bought was back and that they couldn't find it so it had been stolen, I thought they misplaced it somewhere till I looked in my closet as I was gonna get ready to go out and saw it! I immediately freaked out and spoke to my coworker who's been there the longest, and he said to just bring it back after my shift tomorrow, when I came in they told me that the district manager was gonna get lost prevention involved and they had a hidden camera in the back, I was freaking out because I dont remember taking it and just wanted to bring it back! After my shift ended I brought it back and it was found immediately after the day ended.

Come today, the District Manager brings me to back and its obvious he knows it was me, I begin to explain to him about my mental disorder/disability, how I'm trying to get help for it since I finally have health insurance after 5 years as of a monthish ago, how I didnt remember taking it that night and how things were a blur after I brought it to the break area, I wrote down my statement/admission of guilt making sure to include my disability and its history, I'm told not to come back in to work this week and to leave early for the day.

I know legally im not required to say any of my disability especially since at the time of being hired it wasnt as prominent. I'd be lying if I said I wasnt telling myself I'd be fired. The item was a $45 DIY kit, and it was gone for about a day and returned unopened in its bag

Hi, I’m (F16) a Junior in highschool in the U.S. I want to move out of my dad’s house. 

Recently all of my dad’s problems and stuff has come to a head and I need to leave. He has abused me in the past emotionally, leaving me with PTSD like symptoms. I cannot relax around him. His incessant drinking has become a major issue and has effected my family as a whole. He’s driven me home intoxicated, driven intoxicated many, many times. More than I can count. Broken a plate out of anger, fallen asleep outside because he was so wasted.
It came to the last straw for me when I found him on the floor incapacitated. I thought he wasn’t breathing. He has pretty bad sleep apnea some other health issues that can cause real damage to your heart and other things, so I got really scared. This all happened in the last year or so, I’ve just been sitting with it for far too long and need to get out. I don’t have any adults in my life I can talk to, and the only thing I can do past this point is go to court. But should I? And would I have enough against my dad to leave or move to my mom’s? (I can give more specific evidence I think, but I’m sort of throwing this together. If something doesn’t make sense let me know lol) is it even worth it since I’m almost 18?

I had an inhaler before, but it was many years ago when I was in elementary.

So the pediatrician told me it was allergies and prescribed me an inhaler to see if it might help.

Idk how many months later I kinda use the inhaler and I think it kinda helps, but I noticed there’s an awful lot of inhalers in the towel/medicine/bath things closet. 

One is very worn down from being in my backpack and the other was the at home one.

There’s two more (that I can’t remember where they were kept originally) i’ve kinda hidden behind a container in the same closet. So thats four so far.

I also have one in my backpack and from what i’ve collected it seems they come in duos/doubles. 

I wasn’t even looking for the other inhaler. I was looking for my new Neosporin cream for a little cut (which I still haven’t found)

It was obviously my inhaler but the prescription label was ripped off and it was in my mom’s bathroom cabinet.

I know it’s illegal, but I don’t know what to do or even why she has it in the first place. Any advice?

I absolutely do not trust the personnel of my current school. It is a long story and there were many events leading up to me completely losing faith in my school. I cannot even trust the ADA coordinator because I have made complaints to her regarding a problem professor and how she treated me and, she not only dismissed my complaints, she was arguing with me in that professor's favor and made absolutely no attempt to understand where I was coming from. This was in stark contrast with the ADA coordinator from my undergrad university who put in a massive amount of work to advocate on my behalf and who I could trust telling almost anything. It is a small university and even university workers who do not fall under my particular college within the university are very chummy with my college's faculty and staff. While this may make this a great place to work, it is awful to be a student here as the in-group bias is too damn strong with the powers that be. I doubt anything outside of sexual harassment or racism claims would be taken seriously around here.

Anyway, back to the issue at hand: each year, I need to renew my accommodations and, each academic term, I need to give the most updated paperwork stating I am entitled to x,y,z accommodations and discuss, if necessary, how they would be implemented. Usually, there is no meeting necessary since these are mostly straight-forward things. But, this one professor who is very stingy with accommodations wants to meet with me. I have had very bad experiences with her and so have many other students, hence the mountain of complaints against her that will never amount to any sort of action even though she is not even tenured. There is no way in hell I am meeting with her without a recording to back me up because I know that her word will always take precedence over mine. I have responded to her email that, either I be allowed to record audio or we discuss these matters over email or another text-only format to ensure that my accommodations get implemented as such and to ensure neither party falls victim to misunderstanding/misrepresentation. Now, I have not heard back from her yet, but, for about a week, the ADA coordinator has been fighting with me over the recording or email request, insisting that everyone deserves privacy and that I should trust her to ensure I would be safe from inaccurate accusations. But, if privacy is such a concern, why not just discuss over email? It just takes a little bit more work and it is a bit more drawn-out. But, now I am getting concerned that they will outright deny me my accommodations in that professor's class over this despite the options I give. Could they legally do that? What recourse do I have? 

Also, some points I know people will bring up: 

1. No, I cannot transfer: if I did, I would have to start over from scratch since the schools within my field have such varying programs. Believe me, if it were possible, I would have transferred a long time ago. 
2. The reason why I even asked permission to record instead of just recording and not saying anything is because we are in a 2-party consent state when it comes to recording conversations.

My partner and I recently vacated a property at the end of August that we had rented for one year. We had a one year lease (not month to month) that was set to expire on July 31st. Around the second week of July (approx July 9th, I can check phone records for actual date) we informed our landlord that we will not be renewing our lease. We received our security deposit in the mail today, and our landlord withheld ""10 days worth of rent"" since he was not able to rent it for 10 days after we moved out. The wording on the actual notice he wrote to us was

""we are returning the remaining security deposit check. We were able to rent the apartment from the 10th of them month and have reduced your deposit by 10 days rent. We did not receive notice in due time of your intention to vacate. Thank you""

It is my understanding that this is not permitted, as security deposits are to be used only for

""reasonable and itemized costs due to non-payment of rent, damage caused by the tenant beyond normal wear and tear, non-payment of utility charges payable directly to the landlord under the terms of the lease or tenancy, and moving and storage of the tenant's belongings. The landlord may not retain any amount of the deposit for costs relating to ordinary wear and tear of occupancy or damage caused by a prior tenant."" General Obligations (GOB) CHAPTER 24-A, ARTICLE 7, TITLE 1

Finally, the only thing that I think could worry me is that there is a clause in my lease that states:

""Lessee's hold over: Lessee shall no less than 60 days prior to Lease expiration request a new 1 year extension of the existing lease or a new 1 year lease to be dated August 1, 2021. Any new lease or extension will be negotiated to a reasonable fair market increase...""

I think this only applies to if I wanted to renew my lease.

In addition, I wanted to clarify that as a tenant, I do not actually have any obligation to give ""move out notice"" to my landlord, and found this:

NY Consolidated Real Property Law Section 232-b: 

  
A monthly tenancy or tenancy from month to month of any lands or buildings located outside of the city of New York may be terminated by the landlord or the tenant upon his notifying the other at least one month before the expiration of the term of his election to terminate;  provided, however, that **no notification shall be necessary to terminate a tenancy for a definite term.**

**I just would like to clarify a few things:**

1. Am I entitled to receive the entirety of my security deposit back?
2. If I am, I believe my plan will be to:  

   1. contact my landlord and explain to him that I am requesting the rest of my deposit
   2. if above does not work, write my landlord a letter w. certified mail requesting the rest of the deposit, citing the above law.
   3. if above does not work, apply for small claims court to receive the rest of my deposit
3. Does this seem like a reasonable course of action?

Anyways didn't think anything of it because nothing weird had happened until a few hours later where he came to our door and my roommate answered and talked to him for like 10 minutes. He then came in with less thousand yards there and told me that he was with property Management saying we had a few days to get out and we're being evicted and that if we just left our own accord he would not touch our rental history or put an eviction record on there. Something didn't smell right because I had met the landlord a few times and she was really nice and not this guy but they knew each other the next day I heard from the landlord none of that was happening and they just do a few things around the house for her and he didn't speak for her.

He and his roommate rent a house, just moved in 15 days ago. Yesterday, early in the morning, they got a knock on the door from a ""city inspector"" and my friend's roommate let him in. He proceeded to snoop around, then left. He came back a couple hours later, was let in again by the roommate, took a bunch of pictures, and left. He came back a third time a few hours later, and and told them that when the property owner saw the photos, has chosen to evict them and they have 24hr to vacate.

Of course, they called the property manager and were put in contact with the actual owner who they'd not yet met. The owner explained that the owner of the property next door, also being rented, harasses her tenants in hopes of eventually getting her to sell to them.

The house is fully paid off. Their will also lists my father as my mother's general beneficiary and executor of the estate.  Years later, they were legally separated in the same county, and in the agreement on file, the house was deemed my mother's ""separate and sole property"", giving my father rights/restrictions as a tenant, and stating that if she predeceased him, he could maintain his tenancy (under certain conditions) and that he must pay me a certain amount of rent money per month. The separation agreement does not state who the house passes to upon her death.  I don't know why the will or deed were not subsequently updated to reflect the terms of the separation agreement. I know that she wanted the house to pass to me, but I know that doesn't have legal standing if it's not formalized.

She passed away in March and the estate is still in probate. He claims she had both physical copies of the separation agreement and he doesn't remember any of it, so I wrote away to get a copy for myself. It finally came in the mail today. He claimed previously that he was going to update their will to say the house passes to me after he dies, but I haven't seen anything more on that yet.

If the house was her sole and separate property by the document signed and dated *after* the deed and will were signed, and the separation agreement says he must pay me rent *as a tenant*, but the will says he's her prime beneficiary, does that mean he now owns the house again? Or, if there is nothing in the separation agreement stating who the house specifically belongs to, but he is considered only a tenant after her death, does the house now belong to the state?

In the case of being in a state that offer State Disability, I should pursue them as well. But it looks as if New York's State Disability IS The Hartford. 

When I go to make a claim for The Hartford, it asks me if I have filed for State Disability. But since I'm in New York, isn't Hartford itself the State Disability? Or is there another site/place I can go to additionally supplement my loss of income from being unable to work. My company wants me to go all state routes, because it'll simply top-off whatever they pay until it hits 100% of my base pay. So if Hartford agrees to do 80% base pay for 8 weeks, my company will add 20% for 6 weeks.

My location - Los Angeles, California

Defendant - Madrid, Spain

I was effectively scammed by a digital marketing agency coach who signed me up for one on one coaching for $4,000.

**Before**

* I was told I'd be getting 2 one on one mentorship calls a week for a year
* was given access to a video course with lifetime access on Teachable.

**After**

\- No private one on one conversations, they are group calls and one of them is at a time I absolutely cannot make. Also you'd have to wait your turn to ask questions and sometimes you wouldn't get a chance if it went over 2 hours.

\- Calls being cancelled last minute. I was only provided with access to one call in three weeks of being in the program

\- Being charged much more than others for the exact same program. The pricing of the program isn’t advertised anywhere. Some people were charged 1.5k while I was charged 4k

\- The course/coaching doesn't have an agreement or a sales page (intentional so he can charge what he wants)

I asked him for a refund 3 weeks after signing up and he then kicked me out of the program as well as revoked access to the videos and said he'd refund me 25% or $1,000 of the $4,000. I filed a dispute with my credit card and now have to wait 10 days before they submit it.

I have documented proof of everything and there are 15+ other students that feel scammed as well.

The landlord had been complaining a while that property taxes had gone up, and he asked us to pay more in rent because he had seen similar places go for more than what we were paying. We said no. He has been raising the rent as much as he is legally allowed for two years until the pandemic put that on hold. We had been renting for 7 years when he said that he could no longer afford to rent the apartment and that him and his wife had decided to sell the apartment. He said we should expect realtors to come in the following week. We said okay and to give us proper notice (24 hrs) to see the suite. We also said we expect the 60 days from possession date. No response. 

Two weeks later and we haven’t heard anything from him. Then one day he says that now he will be moving into the apartment himself. He says him and his wife are having problems and he thought selling the apartment would alleviate that, but that they were now separating. I found this message odd mainly because he gave too much information. We didn’t need to know about his marital issues or the reason. Something about it was just so off. But he drops off the formal notice to end tenancy and so we make other living arrangements. 

A couple days after the 1st of the month he asked us for the last month’s rent (we had always paid right on time), to which we replied that when a tenant is being evicted they do not owe the last months rent (that’s true for where we are located). No response. I’m not sure if he didn’t know that or if he was hoping we didn’t know that. 

Fast forward a few months, and we can see clearly that this man is not living in the apartment. The apartment’s living room windows, kitchen room windows and balcony are all very visible to the main road. It’s one of the things I hated about living there. We see the same woman quite a bit and it’s not his wife. So at first I’m thinking, okay maybe this is his girlfriend? He did say his marriage was in disarray. But that doesn’t make sense because the day after we moved out we saw his wife in there cleaning. I don’t know many women that would clean an apartment for her husband and his girlfriend to move into. Then one day we saw a man, who was not the landlord, in the kitchen. We’ve driven by the landlord’s house a few times and his truck is there every single time. 

So it’s pretty clear at this point that we were evicted illegally, as the landlord is clearly not living there himself like he said. However proving this is another story. Any advice on what our next steps should be? The regulatory body we called were beyond unhelpful and said “can you get them to admit it?” Uh, I’m thinking not. What kind of evidence can we obtain that would prove our landlord has not moved in? Would contacting the building manager or the Strata help? Are they required to report him if he’s not living there?",legaladvice,"Landlord evicted us to use the property himself, only he’s not living there",https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5q6u1/landlord_evicted_us_to_use_the_property_himself/

I know that the MRTA was just passed on March 31st, which expands protections for New Yorkers in both recreational and medical marijuana use. 

I also want to cite  

**N.Y. Pub. Health Law §§ 3360 to 3369-E; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. Tit. 10, § 1004.18**

**Legal use:** Medical marijuana only

**Rules for employers:** Employers may not discriminate against applicants or employees based on status as a medical marijuana patient, but they may enforce a policy that prohibits employees from working while impaired by marijuana. Employers with four or more employees must also provide reasonable accommodations to medical marijuana users. Employers are not required to take any action that would cause them to violate federal law or lose a federal contract or funding.

This seems like it should be evidence that they can't fire me. 

In addition,  

**SECTION 201-D**

**Discrimination against the engagement in certain activities**

Labor (LAB) CHAPTER 31, ARTICLE 7

§ 201-d.

has been expanded to specifically protect the use of marijuana while not on the job, on work property, or using work equipment. 

The trouble is in the weeds (pun intended) in some of the language in these laws. 

I assume that my new employer has a 'Drug Free Workplace' mention in the job description because of the Federal Drug Free Workplace act of 1988. 

Importantly, the Act limits the above employment protections in the following ways:

&amp;#x200B;

* Employers are still permitted to enact and maintain substance-free workplace policies that prohibit cannabis use during working hours, on company property, and while using an employer’s equipment or other property.

&amp;#x200B;

* Employers may continue taking adverse employment actions against applicants and employees who use cannabis off-duty if: (1) such action is “required by state or federal statute, regulation, ordinance, or other state or federal governmental mandate;” or (2) failure to do so “would require such employer to commit any act that would cause the employer to be in violation of federal law or would result in the loss of a federal contract or federal funding.” Notably, these federal safe harbor provisions are limited as they only apply to specific obligations an employer has (if any) under federal law or regulation (i.e., obligations arising under federal government contracts/grants or drug-testing requirements, like those imposed by the United States Department of Transportation).

It seems that the ""Federal Safe Harbor"" mystery stipulations here are intended as a nod toward USDOT rules and regulations. It's super vague though. My new employer has nothing to do with USDOT. However, I don't have any idea if this employer would feel that not firing me for testing positive for marijuana would be ""a violation of a federal governmental mandate"" if they comply with the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act. I also have no idea if this employer is under some kind of Federal Contract, or if they receive any Federal grant money. 

My worry is that with a certain interpretation of these clauses, this new employer would have grounds to terminate me or rescind my employment offer because keeping me employed with them while testing positive for THC would violate some kind of federal contract or grant money condition that they receive. 

I feel like the work I will be doing is not safety-related at all. It's an office job for a small nonprofit charitable organization. I feel like these new laws were passed to allow any adult protections for off-duty consumption of marijuana, and I feel like medical marijuana patients (such as myself) should have even more protection. 

I just don't want this to bite me in the ass. I don't want some vague interpretation of a federal vs state law issue to be the reason that instead of a new job, I am unemployed and ineligible for unemployment benefits simply for testing positive for THC. 

Some advice (preferably from a NYS based lawyer) would be fantastic.

Recently I filed and was approved for my LLC in NY. I know my next steps are to do the publications for 6 weeks and provide that proof within 120 days... but I have a few other questions as well.

I am a travel agent (yes we still exist, and we're growing very well!) and have an independent contractor status with an agency. They provide me an agency phone number and agency email account. Our email signatures and our business cards are all (for the most part, unless the agent decides to use their LLC name) in the agency's name.

All that being said however, do I have to write my LLC anywhere? (maybe on my email signature?) Clients see us as working in regards with this specific agency. But, all independent contractors here (as well as the industry really) have LLC's to protect their independent business/portfolio. The LLC aspect is more for legal protections and is required by most agencies.

I want it to be valid though, so what should I do? Add it to the bottom of my email signature? Put it on my business card? I don't know of many other agents doing this UNLESS they elect to maintain using their LLC name and just run their tickets through the agency's resources - rather than what most agents do, which is keep the agency's email signature.

Legally speaking, we are not affiliated with, partnered with, nor employees of the agency. They provide us with all the resources we need to take our existing portfolios and book clients. The house will also sometimes refer certain clients to independent agents. The house negotiates the commission rates from vendors/airlines/hotels, etc. And they take a cut of our earnings to compensate for that heavy lifting.

So here is the situation,  \[Takes place in California\]

I have recently graduated from a university. During my time there as a student I was part of a program which offered up to 1000 dollar grants to pay for professional school test prep/testing fees. 

The conditions to qualify for the grant required one to be enrolled at the school. During my spring term (while I was enrolled) I met with my counselor/advisor and attempted to qualify for the grant. my advisor told me that the funds were exhausted for the term but if I went ahead and made a purchase that I would be able to petition during the summer. My advisor was fully aware that I would no longer be enrolled and assured me that it wouldn't be an issue (I explicitly pointed that out during our meeting). 

With the assurance of my advisor in hand and their recommendation, I went ahead and purchased an expensive test prep program, ( I really want to do well on my graduate school test and having the ability to purchase a more extensive prep program because of the school grants support meant a lot to me)  which I otherwise would not have purchased if it was not for the promise of recovering the costs back later.

I recently reached out to my advisor as it is now summer and they told me that I am no longer eligible for the grant as I am no longer enrolled. They acknowledged that ""this is not what we had discussed"" but that they can't do anything about it. 

I don't know a lot about contract law and I understand that this is not an ideal case in any sense: no written agreement, conditions of grant clearly written, promise by employee of the university that the university would pay me.  

However, I feel as if I was led astray by my counselor/advisor whom I trusted to know what they were doing by telling me that it would not be any problem if I petitioned past my graduation date. I feel that what had happened is unfair, but I recognize that sometimes that is just life. 

I was wondering if in this scenario there would be anything actionable in terms of litigation. 

Thank you so much for reading this and taking it into consideration.  I hope you have a wonderful day.",legaladvice,an (unfortunately messy) Contract Law Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5plcp/an_unfortunately_messy_contract_law_question/
2958,BrokenHarp,1629149233,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/p5pkwo/i_am_an_independent_contractor_but_work_may_not/,p5pkwo,False,False,4,1629149244,"I work for an independent advisory firm as a licensed financial advisor. Upon hire I signed a contract stating that I would receive a ""$2000/month salary that will last for a period of 12 months"" once I passed my required tests. I also have to pay my own fees to our compliance/broker dealer for state licensing fees, E+O coverage , fees for their service and social media monitoring.  I am ""responsible for health, dental and vision insurance costs."" They ""offer a plan but the expense is 100%"" on me. I believe I signed a W9 at hire and I was under the impression I was an independent contractor. I can keep business expenses as a tax write-off, I know that.    


My company keeps a portion of the fees I charge to clients for the creation of financial plans, managing assets and selling insurance. Another employee here (Who they classify as an employee) actually builds the plans, and second employee helps manage the assets by building model portfolios to follow. I can also go to him for advice. I have some degree as far as what I'd like my client to invest in, so long as it's approved by the client and matches their risk profile, but I largely follow his models.    


The catalyst for my post is that I am trying to find some time to see my therapist on a biweekly basis. He is only in town 2 specific days. My ""mentor"" at work, who is basically my manager, has been helping me and I believe has my best interest in mind has let me know to be at work from 8 AM to 4 PM M-F. He explained everyone else largely works for me, so I need to be here before them, and leave after them. I also know he soon wants me to stay until 9 PM or so on Mondays for ""Monday night dialing."" This job has been hard on my mental health. I am tired. It is very stressful and I am not guaranteed success, so I've been working my ass off. I often go to networking events after work, or study for other semi-required licenses. As a result I decided to see my therapist again. I asked my mentor if I could leave work 15 minutes early to see my therapist from 4 - 5 PM every other Monday.  

""Biweekly appointments Monday at 4 PM. I will have to leave work at 3:45 every other Monday. I can come back for Monday night dialing, although I would prefer to do that on Thursdays I think. That was the best option we could find.""    


He replied ""I'll think about it and let you know tomorrow.""  


I replied ""Oh, alright. I mean it's my therapist, so keep that in mind I guess. The other option is tuesday at 2 or 3 if monday is important. I go because he keeps me out of my own head with this job""  


He replies ""I'll let you know tomorrow""    


This comes after being questioned by this same mentor and the owner of the company for being 2 hours late after getting a flat tire repaired. I had even asked the night before if I was allowed to take care of it before work. They told me I should ask for a ride, or be more creative next time.  

My understanding is that as an independent contractor I have the right and ability to leave when I want ESPECIALLY for a mental health reason. I often feel like he enjoys having power over me. I appreciate his advice and help (Sometimes he passes clients to and leads to me), but I also was looking forward to the freedom being an independent contractor allows. It's one of the biggest reasons I took such a large risk and pay cut when signing here.  I feel like I was mislead with this job. They assure me the freedom comes later when I have a developed book of business.    


He hasn't told me I can't go yet, but him saying that really stressed me out and has made me feel trapped. I'm also beginning to wonder if they legally need to define me as an employee given the following:    


\-I've been trained and guided in a specific manner to do things a certain way. I.E what to say on phone calls, what questions to ask etc.  


\-I've been given instructions on where and when to work. I've never been punished for being late per say, just questioned and mildly harassed.    


\-My services are integrated into the business operations because the services are important to the success or continuation of the business.  


\-I certainly have a continuing relationship with this firm, and I was told I was not allowed to get a job outside of the firm especially one where other people might see me. The reasoning is that I would not be focusing on this job and that it is a bad look for your financial advisor to be serving coffee.  


\-I am required to work in the office, although it is no problem if I leave during normal work hours for networking, coffee etc. I just have to justify it. I guess therapy doesn't qualify...    


\-I am not paid straight commission, I am paid weekly for the first year.    


\-Although I haven't asked, I would most likely not be allowed to work for another firm - For a variety of reasons.  


\-My firm definitely requires ""when, where, and how I do my job. ""    


Even if he decides to let me leave 15 minutes early tomorrow, I don't think he's allowed to say ""let me think about it"" or even give me trouble for being late...

I want to paint a glock, simply put I want it a different color. 

 

On glocks, I believe, the lower receiver is where the serial number is located and that is the ""firearm"" (not all guns are like this). I am buying this gun instead of legally making it because I want to give a prosecutor as little shit to complain about in the event that \*something\* happens. Even if it doesn't mean using a firearm. 

 

I also have some problems with white supremacists and other general BS in my area. And I believe that it is probably good OPsec not to have my serial number out in the open, My intelligence does indicate that some local groups are trying really hard to identify people with their firearms. 

 

Basically when I paint this gun, if I paint over the number I would make it difficult for a photograph to distinguish the firearm and in turn myself. 

 

But also I dont want this to be considered ""damaging the serial number,"" as I have absolutely 0% trust in our legal system, I want to know if this showed up in court if they would have a legal leg to stand on.

&amp;#x200B;

We are located in Alberta Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short my mother is getting her and my fathers will in order.  

&amp;#x200B;

They have a lot of equity in land, and a fair amount in cash, but due to their low pension income they required my income to be on their mortgage in order to purchase a house a few years ago.   In doing this I am also on the title to their home as 1/3 share.

&amp;#x200B;

She was advised by her lawyer to add my brother to the title to keep things simple  - when my parents pass we both get the house.  So, I would go from 1/3 ownership to 1/4 ownership, moving to half ownership when my parents pass. All good so far.

&amp;#x200B;

The confusing part is with (just) me being on the mortgage when my parents pass.  For simplicities sake lets say the property is worth 400k and the mortgage is 200k.  What I would assume would happen, as with any residential sale, is that once we decide to sell the house, the proceeds are held by the lawyer and any liens against the property (regardless of who they are owed to) are paid off and the remainder is distributed to the owners.  Am I correct in assuming this?

We were given a “notice to vacate” our place due to our landlord selling her place with a 30 day notice. We had to find a place quickly and this was the only place in our price range. We were only going to get a 3 bedroom (put the 2 boys in 1 room, my daughter in another) and were told the unit would be available before the date we needed to move in. Date came and went. Unit wasn’t available. We kept getting “I’m working on it”. We ended up having to take a 4 bedroom because this was the only place with any open units at all in our price range. Even when we moved it, the place was poorly cleaned, a lot of stuff wasn’t fixed, there was trash outside (the trash was removed over the course of a week by the complex), etc

The complex is doing the same to my friend (her landlord basically did the same to her that our landlord did) except she needs a 4 br and they’re trying to push her into a 3br. They have had her on the back burner for a month. To hold a unit, they have you put $400 down and are supposed to contact you 3x a week with updates. They are still advertising “UNITS AVAILABLE!!!!” but can’t even get people they’re promising units to into their units and are currently giving my friend the run around.

I bought a house a few years ago with my girlfriend in Florida.

(A box break is  when a box of cards is divided up among collectors who purchase the  right to receive cards to that specific team).

During  the live stream, the seller pulled an $7,000-$10,000 card for LaMelo  Ball who plays for the team I purchased. However this card was a  ""redemption card"" meaning that the player did not submit their  autographed card in time for the release of this card product so this  ""redemption card"" is for a future delivery of said card.

He  first tried scamming by sending the package to an incorrect address  with the package opened and retaped to blame the ""missing"" card on  household it was delivered. USPS and I cleared up this scheme very  quickly.  Obviously the package I received did not contain the $10k card  and only contained a single card worth less than $1.

After  confronting him about this he admitted that he didn't send it to me the  redemption card and the reason being that since the ""redemption card""  didn't explicitly  state ""Charlotte Hornets"" that he didn't send it to  me. I showed him  that he didn't have a ""redemption spot"" for sale or  sold during this  specific break and now he claims he sold a separate  redemption spot in a DIFFERENT auction.

I have a copy of our full conversation done through eBay messaging as well as other images countering his lies if anyone is interested.

It had a total hours worked between all 3 stores and the owners umbrella label was the name on all my checks.
